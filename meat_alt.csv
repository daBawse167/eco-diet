Ginger chilli Tofu Steaks,"
Ingredients

1 pack of tofu (396g)
1 red chilli. Deseeded and finely chopped
3 tbsp tamari or dark soya sauce
Juice from 1 large orange
1 tsp coconut oil
3 balls of stem ginger, sliced finely into strips
1/2 tsp coconut sugar
Zest from 1 large orange
Black pepper
Optional: ½ tbsp Pulsin protein powder to thicken the sauce

","
Method
 

Drain the water from the tofu and blot. Slice into chunky steaks approximately 1.5cm thick.


In a container large enough to accommodate the tofu steaks, mix together the marinade ingredients: ginger, chilli, coconut sugar, tamari or soya sauce, orange zest, orange juice and black pepper. If you are using protein powder, add this to the sauce later.


Immerse the tofu steaks. Cover and pop in the fridge for at least an hour to allow the flavours of the marinade to soak in.


Melt coconut oil in a shallow pan. Drain the steaks from the sauce and on a low-heat pan-fry for about 8-10 mins, turning over half-way through with a fish-slice. Alternatively, you can grill the steaks (allow 9-10 mins).


While the steaks are cooking, mix in the protein powder to the sauce (if using) and heat gently in a saucepan. Pour over the steaks. Serve. Enjoy!

Steak and Ale Pie,"
Ingredients

Jus-Roll frozen puff pastry (or similar) – ready rolled or blocks
One large white onion, sliced
A few cloves of garlic (more or less depending on how garlicky you like your food), chopped
Dried parsley, salt, pepper and any other of your favourite herbs.
5 – 6 large field mushrooms or around 10 smaller variety mushrooms. Chestnut mushrooms are lovely as they have a nice nutty flavour. Slice thickly
A pack of Fry’s thick-cut chunky strips (or other beef substitute)
Bisto original gravy granules or other vegan granules
A cup of Vegan ale – Check Barnivore, a great vegan alcohol website. If you don’t drink alcohol, replace with water.

","
Method

Fry the onion and garlic, herbs and seasoning in some oil until a little soft.
Add the mushrooms and “meat” strips and fry until the strips start to look browned
Add the ale and sprinkle in the gravy granules, a tablespoon at a time until it starts to thicken. Make sure the gravy isn’t watery, as it will make the pastry really soggy. It just needs to cover the ingredients in the pan.
Roll out the pastry, line a roasting dish with it and place the pie filling in the dish. Place the pastry on the top and squash the edges of the bottom layer and the top of the pie together with a fork. If you want less pastry, you can leave off the bottom layer and just have the top. Don’t worry if it looks a mess, when the pastry puffs up, it will look fab! And if the gravy overflows and runs out, even better!
Cook at 200 degrees for about half an hour, or until the pastry looks nice and brown.

BLACKENED ROASTED CAULIFLOWER ‘STEAKS’,"


Ingredients



Units
USM 

Scale
1x2x3x 




1 – 2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large head cauliflower
blackened, creole or cajun seasoning of choice (recipe for homemade below)
1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes
chopped fresh parsley, to serve
lemon wedges, to garnish
grain of choice – quinoa, brown rice or farro
himalayan salt, to taste
fresh ground pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Prep the Cauliflower: Place the cauliflower stem side down, and using a sharp knife cut into the top center and slice the cauliflower in half. You want to create as many cauliflower steaks as you can from the center cut out that will be at least 3/4 inch thick. The remaining sides and pieces can be cut into cauliflower nuggets and roasted alongside the steaks, or on a separate baking sheet. I feel it’s best to use two baking sheets to prepare this meal. Using two will give you plenty of room for the steak slices to be turned over without too much crowding.
Roasting: Grease your baking sheet/s and carefully place your cauliflower steaks along with the broken florets, or place the florets on a separate baking sheet. Using an small brush, gently brush the ‘steaks’ and florets with oil. Sprinkle as much seasoning as you wish to coat on ‘steaks’ and florets. Add your tomatoes to the baking sheet, you can coat these with oil too and add a sprinkle of sea salt.
Place your baking sheet into the oven, if using two, place sheets on separate racks or side by side, depending on the size. Bake for 15 minutes, gently flip ‘steaks’ and stir florets, season again and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
Serve immediately with roasted tomatoes, grain of choice, sprinkle of chopped parsley and lemon wedges.
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 4 days, in a covered container.

Curried Bean Burgers in Portabello Buns,"
Ingredients
Burgers and ‘buns’:

2 cartons (400g drained) cannellini beans
2 medium carrots
1 large parsnip
2 portobello mushrooms per person (or a bun of your choice)
1/3 ripe avocado per person
2 tbsp chickpea flour (can substitute for another kind of flour)
4 tbsp tomato puree
2 tbsp water
1 1/2 tbsp curry powder
1 tsp paprika powder
1 tsp chilli powder
Grind of pepper

Sweet potato fries:

1 small- medium sweet potato per person
glug of olive oil
salt & pepper

","
Method

Peel and grate the carrots and parsnip and put them on a baking tray to roast for about 5 minutes. Rinse and drain the beans, then transfer them to a bowl and mash with a fork. Add in the spices and 2 table spoons tomato puree then mash again. Next mix in the carrot, parsnip and chickpea flour. You should have a stiff dough that sticks together.
Take a handful of the mixture and shape it into a burger patty. Place on a floured baking tray. Do this until you have 6-8 burgers. Put the burgers into the oven to cook for 30 minutes, turning once.
To make the sweet potato fries peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into chip shapes. Make sure not to make them too fat otherwise they will take too long to cook! Place all of the fries on a baking tray with room between them and coat with a glug of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and put in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.
To make the ‘buns’ remove the mushroom stork and peel off the skin. Place the mushrooms on a baking tray and put it in the oven once the burgers have been cooking for 20 minutes. Turn the burgers over if you haven’t done so already. After 5 minutes turn over the mushrooms.
Mix the remaining 2 table spoons of tomato puree with two table spoons of water to make a quick tomato sauce. Then mash the avocado.
Remove the mushrooms and burgers from the oven. The mushrooms should have softened but still be able to hold the weight of the burgers. Make the burger by layering a mushroom with tomato sauce, a curried bean burger, avocado, a second burger and a mushroom.
The fries should be done by now so remove them from the oven and serve with the burgers.

Beyond Le Fume Burger,"
Ingredients

2 vegan brioche bun or ciabatta buns, sliced in half and toasted or grilled lightly with a touch of olive oil or vegan butter
3 tablespoons vegan mayo mixed with 2 teaspoons of French mustard
½ beef tomato, sliced thickly
½ red onion, sliced thinly
A large handful of rocket or crispy salad leaves
½ an aubergine, sliced into ½ inch thick discs
A large glug of olive oil
1 large courgette, cut into thin strips
5 tablespoons plain flour
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
½ pint almond milk
2 Beyond Meat patties
2 tablespoons Belazu smoked semi-dried tomatoes
2 slices of Violife vegan cheddar cheese
Salt & pepper to taste

","
Method

First, prepare the aubergine: sprinkle the discs lightly with salt and leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour before patting dry with kitchen paper. Heat a grill pan or griddle on high, then toss in the aubergine slices with the olive oil. Grill until browned, roughly 3-5 minutes on each side.
Set the aubergines aside and prepare the courgette: wash, pat dry and trim the courgettes. Cut into thin chips, place in a bowl, sprinkle with salt and mix thoroughly. Then add almond milk enough to cover courgettes. Leave for 30 minutes, so they have time to release any bitter juices. If you have a deep-fat fryer, heat the oil to 180°C. If not, choose a sturdy deep saucepan with jam thermometer clipped to the side, or alternatively heat to medium low.
Pour the plain flour into a large mixing bowl. Season with a good sprinkle of salt and black pepper, and the cayenne pepper. Drain the milk from the courgettes, then toss the courgettes into the flour until they’re lightly coated. Fry for 2–3 minutes, or until golden and crisp, then tip on to crumpled kitchen paper to remove any excess oil.
Next, reheat the grill pan or griddle and grill the Beyond Meat patties until browned, roughly 2 minutes on each side.
Finally, build your burger: spread the bottom half of your sliced brioche or ciabatta with a thick layer of the mustard mayo. Add rocket, followed by the tomato, onion, grilled aubergine, Beyond Meat Patty, Violife cheddar, smoked semi-dried tomatoes and lastly the crispy courgettes. Top with the second half of the bun, press down lightly and serve immediately.

Method

Slice the zucchini and vegan cheese, grill the slices for about 2 to 3 minutes in a hot grill pan on both sides till grill marks are showing and set aside. Also cut the fig in slices.
Cut the burger buns lengthwise and grill both cutting sides until grill marks are showing.
Grill the burgers according to the instructions on the package and place slices of the vegan cheese on it while the burgers are still warm.

Spicy Bean Burgers with Avocado Salsa,"
Ingredients

1 large red onion 
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves of garlic
2 medium courgettes
2 medium carrots 
1 x 400g tin of kidney beans 
100g cooked rice
1 tbsp harissa paste
2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter, or use sunflower seed butter if making nut free
A small bunch of coriander
50g sesame seeds
For the avocado salsa:
½ yellow pepper
2 tomatoes
1 large ripe avocado
2 tomatoes
½ a small red onion
1 red chilli
Juice of 2 limes
A small bunch of coriander

","
Preparation
I like to use the outer leaves of an iceberg lettuce to wrap round the burgers, acting as a crisp bun.  That way you can add the salsa and perhaps a little hummus to make a real feast of it. It’s really important that you grate the carrot and courgette by hand as using a food processor can make them very soggy.
Makes 10 burgers       

Method
Place the tomatoes in a bowl and pour over boiling water, leave for 1 minute, drain the water off and gently remove the skin by peeling it off with a small sharp knife. Cut the tomatoes in half and using a teaspoon, scoop out the seeds and discard. Set the remaining tomato flesh aside.
Finely dice the onion, deseed the chilli and chop very finely.  Slice the avocado in half, remove the stone and then using a spoon scoop out the flesh in one half and then finely chop.  Slice the tomato flesh and yellow pepper into very small juice and then combine all of the ingredients into a bowl.  Pour over the lime juice, finely chop the coriander and stir through.  Season to taste, cover and leave to stand in the fridge until ready to use.
Finely chop the onion and crush the garlic.  Trim the ends from the courgette and carrots and then coarsely grate using a hand held grater.  Finely chop the coriander and set aside.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large frying pan and add the onion, fry gently for around 5 minutes or until softened and slightly coloured at the edges.  Add the garlic, courgettes and carrots to the pan, turn up the heat to medium – high and fry for a further 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the carrots and courgettes have softened and cooked through.
Add the peanut butter and harissa to the pan, season well and continue to cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly, until blended with the vegetables.  Take off the heat and leave to stand for five minutes or until cool enough to handle.  Meanwhile, drain and rinse the kidney beans and place them in a food processor.  Blitz until you have a smooth paste and then transfer to a large mixing bowl.  Alternatively, you can place the kidney beans into the mixing bowl and mash by hand, using a fork, until you have a thick paste.
Add the cooked rice, coriander and vegetable mixture to the beans and beat together until combined and pulled into a large ball.  Take a handful of the mixture – about 3 tablespoons worth – and shape into a patty approximately 2 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.  Scatter the sesame seeds over a flat plate, season and mix together before lightly rolling the burgers in them so that they are evenly coated.  Cover the burgers in clingfilm and refrigerate for 1 hour before cooking.
When ready to cook, heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan and cook for about 10 minutes, turning over once or twice, until golden brown and cooked through.

Curried Chickpea Burgers,"
Ingredients

175g cooked quinoa
1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 carrots
1 white onion
1 tbsp curry paste of your choice, just ensure it is gluten and dairy free
3 tbsp gram flour
3 tbsp olive oil

","
Preparation

Makes 8 burgers

They freeze well and you don’t need to worry about defrosting them, you can simply fry them gently from frozen until cooked through, making them handy little things. 

Method
Begin by peeling the onion and carrots and then finely grating, either by hand or using a food processor. Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan and then gently fry the onion and carrots until softened – approximately 10 minutes.
Place the chickpeas and cooked quinoa into a large mixing bowl and crush together with a fork until you have a coarse, lightly-bound paste.  Add the softened onion, carrot and curry paste, season with a little sea salt and black pepper and mash together with a fork until bound together.
Using your hands, form the mixture into 8 burger patties and then coat each burger in gram flour, using as much or as little flour as you need to generously coat the burgers.
Heat the remaining oil in the large frying pan over a medium flame, add the burgers to the pan and fry the burgers on both sides until golden, slightly crisp and heated through.
While the cakes are frying dice the tomatoes, avocado and coriander.  Mix together in a small bowl with the lemon juice and season to taste.  Serve the burgers with a little pile of tomato salad on top and whatever accompaniments you like – roasted sweet potato wedges and a big green salad go very well.

Sweet Potato Bean Burgers with Maple Dijon Sauce,"

•	½ Tb. Ground Flaxseed
•	1 ½ Tb. Water
•	1 1/3 cup Cooked Sweet Potato
•	1 cup Canned Garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
•	2 Tb. Dry Quick Oats
•	2 T. + 1/3 c. (divided) Bread Crumbs – regular, panko, whole wheat or gluten-free all work!
•	1-2 T. Finely Chopped White or Yellow Onion
•	3/4 tsp. of EACH Cinnamon, Chili Powder, Garlic Powder, and Salt
Maple Dijon Sauce
•	1/3 c. Maple Syrup
•	1/3 c. Dijon Mustard

","
Preparation
This sweet take on veggie burgers is sure to impress your family and friends. Makes 4 Burgers or 8 mini Patties!

First, roast two large or three medium sized sweet potatoes (poked several times with a fork) in a 375 degree oven for about 45 – 60 minutes. They’ll be very soft and fork tender when they’re done. You may not need to use ALL of the cooked sweet potato.
Next, combine the water and ground flaxseed in a small bowl and then set it aside for now.
In a medium-sized bowl, place your garbanzo beans and mash them up with a potato masher or large fork, leaving some beans partially intact.
To the same bowl, add your cooked sweet potato, dry oats, 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs, onion, spices and salt. Finally, add the flaxseed/water mixture and then stir it all together.
Form this mixture into four equal-sized patties. Then, coat each side with breadcrumbs and put them in a lightly oiled pan over medium-high heat.
While those patties are cooking, prep your Maple Dijon Sauce by combining the maple syrup and mustard in a small bowl.
After approximately 5 – 7 minutes, flip the burgers.
While you’re waiting for the second side to cook, prep your other toppings. I like to use lettuce, tomato and sometimes a bit of sliced avocado!
Once those burgers form a nice crispy brown surface on each side, remove them from the pan and sprinkle them with a small pinch of salt and pepper.
If you’re like me and love a toasted bun, now would be the time to place those buns in the hot pan to lightly toast on each side.
The last step? Place those burgers on your buns, drizzle with plenty of Maple Dijon Sauce, load up your toppings, and enjoy!
This recipe can also be used to make a killer appetizer or side dish! Just form the mixture into small cakes instead of patties.

1–2 avocados, peeled and sliced
Tomato relish or ketchup
Pickled cucumber (see above)
A few handfuls of spinach leaves
8 seeded burger buns (I use wholemeal ones)

","
Preparation
I’ve played around with a lot of recipes before settling on this one, some full of bright herb freshness and grated veg, some packed with protein-rich tofu, and all were good, but what I look for in a burger is a deep moreish favour, savoury and complex, so this is the one.
I use brown rice here, but any cooked grain you have will do – quinoa, pearl barley and farro all work well.
I like to make a quick pickled cucumber to top these with. Thinly slice a quarter of a cucumber and pop it into a bowl with a pinch of salt, a squeeze of agave syrup, and a good tablespoon of white wine vinegar, then scrunch together and leave to sit while you make your burgers. A homemade quick pickle that beats a gherkin any day. 🙂

Method
Get a large pan on a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil. Once the pan is good and hot, add the mushrooms and thyme and season with salt and pepper. Fry on a good heat until the mushrooms have dried out and are slightly browned, then set to one side and leave to cool.
Next, drain the white beans and put them into a food processor with the dates, garlic, parsley, tahini and soy sauce. Pulse until you have a smoothish mixture, then transfer to a bowl and add the rice, breadcrumbs, lemon zest and the cooled mushrooms. Mix well, then put into the fridge for 10 minutes or so to firm up.
Once cooled, divide the mixture into 8 portions and shape into 8 patties.  Place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper and pop into the fridge until needed. (This can be done the day before – and the burgers freeze well at this point.)
Preheat your oven to 230°C/fan 210°C/gas 8 and bake the burgers for 15 minutes, until nicely brown. If you like cheese on your burger, pop a slice on top a couple of minutes before they come out of the oven.
While your burgers are cooking, get your toppings ready. I go with avocado, tomato relish and the quick cucumber pickle above, plus a few spinach leaves. Hummus, grated carrot and sprouts is another favourite, but feel free to improvise and try it your own way.
Once the burgers are golden, toast your buns and layer up your burgers. I like to serve them with the sweet potato fries. You can’t beat a burger and chips, and these ones are as healthy as they are tasty.

Marlene’s V.I.P. Burger,"
Ingredients

The Meaty Part:
1 jar seitan
1 pack tempeh
1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp shoyu or tamari sauce
1 cup water
Sauté the vegetables:
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 celery stalks finely diced

2 shallots, finely diced
10 fresh shitake mushrooms
½ tsp herbs de Provence
¼ tsp each, ginger powder, turmeric, paprika
1 tbsp mirin
1 tbsp shoyu or tamari sauce
4 tbsp rice flower
4 tbsp strong wheat flour
2 tbsp organic sunflower oil for frying

","
Method

Mince the seitan chunks by using a small hand grinder and transfer to a bowl.
Crumble the tempeh in your fingers and add to the seitan.
Heat the oil in a pan and add the ground seitan and crumbled tempeh.
Stir well to coat in oil and then add the shoyu sauce and water stir and then cover.
Simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed.
Return the ingredients to the mixing bowl.
Warm the wok or pan and add the oil.
Stir in the garlic, celery, carrots, shallots, mushrooms, herbs and seasonings. Mix to coat all the contents in oil.
Add the mirin and shoyu and pop the lid on the pan and cook on low heat for 5 minutes.
Place this mixture into the seitan/tempeh bowl and mix well. Sprinkle the flour on top and using a spatula blend and fold until you achieve a solid consistency.
I then prefer to chill the mixture for one hour or more in the fridge to allow the mixture to stiffen.
To make the burgers simply take one heaped tablespoon of mixture and roll in your hands, squeezing and then flatten into a burger shape.
Warm the sunflower oil in a deep based pan and add the burgers, fry on each side for 5 minutes until crisp and golden.

Delicious served on toasted sourdough. Spread vegan mayonnaise on the bread; add a hefty layer of rocket or other salad greens (pre-dressed) in your favourite salad dressing.  Pop on a burger and top with some homemade pickles or relish, sliced tomatoes or whatever your heart desires.

Santa Fe Black Bean Burger (Vegan),"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 can (14 oz) organic black beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup oats (rolled or quick)
1/4 cup flax meal or flour of choice (see notes)
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne or chipotle powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pink salt
1/4 cup chunky salsa or pico de gallo, give or take
1 tablespoon olive oil, for pan-frying
cornmeal, for dusting (I used coarse grind) (optional)


","

Instructions


Mash black beans: In a medium-size bowl, mash black beans with a strong fork or use a potato masher, leaving some chunks for texture if you like. 
Make patty mixture: Add oats, flour, spices, salt, and salsa, mix again, feel free to use your hands if you like to. If the mixture is too wet, add more flax meal/flour to the mix, but really it should be ok. Taste for flavor.
Shape patties: Divide the mixture and shape your patties into whatever size you like. I like to make 2 jumbo-sized burger patties, but you can make 3 – 4 smaller ones. Give a light dusting of cornmeal if you have it. It will give a nice crunch, flavor and cook up crispy.
Cook on the stovetop, oven, or grill:

Stovetop: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet on medium. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side. It’s ok if the cornmeal gets a little crispy. Trust me, it’s delicious!
Oven (oil-free): Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone mat. Place patties on a baking sheet, place in the oven on the center rack, and bake for 10 – 15 minutes, flip and repeat.

Serve with your choice of accompaniments such as red onion slices, leafy greens, salsa, or Vegan Mayo. Add some mashed avocado as a spread or sliced avocado if you prefer. Or serve on a bed of leafy greens. 
Makes 2 jumbo-sized patties or 3 – 4 smaller ones.

Quinoa + White Bean Veggie Burger,"


Ingredients



Units
USM 

Scale
1x2x3x 




1/2 cup dried quinoa
1 cup water
1/2 cup corn, fresh, canned, or frozen
1/2 cup red bell pepper, finely diced (about 1/2 bell pepper)
1/2 cup shallot, finely diced (about 1 medium) or red onion
2 teaspoons thyme, divided (oregano would be good too)
1 teaspoon EACH garlic + onion powder
1/2 – 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon chipotle or chili powder, optional
1 can (15 oz.) white beans (I used great northern), drained and rinsed
juice of one small lemon
1/2 cup flax meal (or flour of choice)
mineral salt & cracked pepper, to taste
olive oil, to grease

To Serve:

tomato, sliced
leafy greens
avocado, sliced or mashed
red onion, sliced
whole-grain or dijon mustard (hummus or vegan mayo is great too)
sriracha or Sriracha Cashew Cream (use the sriracha cream in place of mustard)
burger buns of choice


","

Instructions


If baking in the oven, turn oven to 375 degrees F. (It’s helpful to read instructions first before making the patties)
Quinoa: In a medium pot, add the quinoa, water, red bell pepper, corn, onion, garlic + onion powder, thyme, paprika, and salt. Give a gentle stir, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.
Mash the beans: While the quinoa is cooking, drain and mash the white beans. You can quickly mash the beans in your colander if it has smaller-sized holes (it’ll save you a dish to wash). I mash about 3/4 of the beans, leaving a quarter of the batch whole or somewhat whole.
Add beans and flax meal: Once quinoa is done, remove the cover and stir in the mashed white beans and flax meal, mixing well. Let the mixture cool for 10 – 15 minutes. Taste for flavor – seasoning to taste with salt, pepper, and other spices.
Divide and make your patties: I like to pat my mixture into the bowl a little and divide it with a knife into 4 sections, making a plus sign if you will. Take each section and pack it tightly into a ball in the palm of your hands. Flatten with your palms and place on a hard surface. Cup the edges with your palm, tighten them in a bit, and squeeze together any cracks that have formed. Flatten the top to the desired size. Mine were about 1/2 inch thick with a 3 1/2 – 4 inch diameter.
Cook one of two ways:

Oven: In the oven at 375 degrees on a greased or parchment-lined cookie sheet for 30 minutes, turning once after 15 minutes. I also added a sprinkle of himalayan salt to the top before baking.
Stovetop: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil over medium to medium-high heat. Cook patties for about 4 – 5 minutes on each side. Burgers should be lightly charred, crispy, and browned on the outside with a tender center.

I cooked both ways and had no preference. They both held up well and cooked great.
Makes 4 jumbo patties

","

Instructions


Saute: In a small pan or skillet, heat oil/water over medium heat, add onion and saute for about 5 – 7 minutes, onions should be tender and slightly golden on the edges. Let onions cool a bit before moving to the food processor.
Glaze: Next, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, maple syrup, tamari, tomato paste, and sriracha. Mix well, and set aside to let the flavors mingle. Taste again, adding more of any ingredient to suit your taste.
Process: Using a food processor, add slightly cooled onions, quinoa/rice, black beans, flaxseed meal, and spices/herbs. Pulse for 5 – 6 seconds at a time, until about half the mixture is combined. Be careful not to over-process, you want some chunkiness from the beans and onions.
Mix: Place mixture in a mixing bowl. You’ll notice once you remove the mixture, the underneath part will be more processed than the top. Using your hands or spatula, mix together well.
Patties: Form 4 round jumbo balls, making sure to pack the balls together well. Flatten each ball into a patty, about 3/4 inch thick, and smooth any cracks along the edges. Place on prepared baking sheet. Alternately, you can make 6 regular-sized patties or 8 sliders.
HOW TO COOK
Oven: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with silpat, parchment paper, or lightly grease with oil. Place baking sheet in preheated oven and bake for 12 – 15 minutes. Using a spatula, gently flip patties and bake another 12 – 15 minutes. Brush tip and sides with balsamic glaze. Let cool a few minutes before serving.
Stovetop: Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat, add patties, and cook 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Carefully flip patties and cook another 5 minutes. Remove, brush with balsamic glaze.
Grill: Preheat grill to medium-high heat, on greased grill, place patties and cook 5 minutes, carefully flip and cook another 5 minutes, or until lightly browned and/or charred. Remove, brush with balsamic glaze.

Vegan Chicken Nuggets,"
Ingredients

Vegan chicken nuggets ingredients:
400g firm tofu
80g chickpea flour
5 tbsp nutritional yeast
3 tbsp American mustard
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
Cracked black pepper
Other ingredients:
Breadcrumbs (e.g. gluten-free ones)
On the side:
Potato salad
Ketchup

","
Method
Start squeezing all the water out of 400g of firm tofu. This takes about 20 minutes. The more you squeeze the water out of tofu the more it will absorb flavours.
Then roughly crumble the tofu into a food processor and all other ingredients. Blend well until you get a smooth mixture. You may need to add a TINY bit of water as well. And don’t taste the mixture, the uncooked chickpea flour tastes bitter and needs to be cooked first before it is consumed.
Then spoon out the mixture with a tablespoon. And press into a bowl with breadcrumbs. Bread evenly on all sides and then fry in hot oil until golden brown (make sure the oil is hot). Place on a kitchen towel as it will absorb some of the excess oil.
Serve on its own with ketchup or other dips or with a delicious Austrian potato salad. Enjoy!

Beer Battered Chicken Bites,"
Ingredients

1/2 cup of chicken-style pieces
1 1/2 cup plain flour
1tsp baking powder
1 x 375ml of chilled vegan beer/lager (I used Coors Light but as long as it is vegan feel free to choose your personal favourite)
1/2tsp each of salt
pepper
onion powder and garlic powder
2tsp dried mixed herbs
Around 400ml of oil for frying but the exact amount depends on the size of your fryer.

","
Preparation

You’ll need to pre-heat the oil in your deep fryer.
If your chicken-style pieces are frozen then begin by defrosting them ready for use.


Method
Add together all of the dry ingredients – flour, baking powder and dried seasonings – and combine well.
Make a well in the centre of the dried ingredients and add the bottle of chilled beer. Stir well to combine until a smooth batter has formed.
You can drop a small amount of batter into the frying oil if you need to check to see if it is hot enough. The oil will sizzle and the batter begin to puff up if the oil is indeed hot enough.
Dip the chicken-style pieces into the batter and, once fully coated, drop carefully into the oil. You may need to do this in several batches if you have only a small fryer so be patient and be sure not to overcrowd the fryer because the batter needs enough room to properly cook.
Fry for 5 minutes or so, until crispy and golden in appearance, and then transfer to a paper towel in order to remove the oily residue.
Serve up as a side dish to any Chinese meal, with chips and ketchup or even as a snack on its own with sweet chilli sauce.

Ingredients

1 lb / 450g Maitake Mushroom clusters
1 Cup / 250ml Oil for frying
3 Cups / 375g Panko breadcrumbs
3 Cups / 375g Crumbled BBQ potato chips
3 Cups / 375g Flour
1 Tbsp salt, coarse grind Sea Salt
1 Tbsp poultry seasoning
1 Tbsp black pepper, fine grind
3 Cups / 360ml Follow Your Heart Vegan Egg wash mixture
1/2 Cup / 120ml hot sauce

","
Preparation
Serves 4

Method

Heat cast iron skillet or heavy-duty saucepan to med heat. On 1/2 sheet pan lay out all mushrooms in whole clusters, drizzle and lightly dab 1 t of oil to the mushrooms. Apply a light coat in which the seasoning will stick to, sprinkle dry seasoning then add to heated cast iron pan and weigh down with additional cast iron pan, a brick wrapped in tin foil or heavier cover to create a press. Cook for 2 -3 minutes then flip over being careful not to tear the mushroom breasts. Sprinkle a bit more of seasoning and then press with pan again. Repeat this process several times until mushrooms are condensed and pressed into light golden brown pieces with no liquid in the pan.

NOTE: Depending on the mushrooms (cause they’re all different) some will leach more liquid than others. Don’t fret it might take a couple minutes longer to cook but the liquid will dissipate. After they are pressed and golden, remove mushrooms from heat and cool.

In medium-size bowl or container add pressed shrooms and Haute sauce to marinate for at least an hour or overnight.
In three separate bowls get the breading station ready.

Seasoned flour with a little salt and pepper
Make Vegan egg wash mixture by following directions on Follow Your Heart Vegan Egg
Make panko crumb crust by adding panko, BBQ potato chips, and seasoning to food processor and pulse until coarse grind consistency.


Lightly dredge each piece of shroom, first in flour to coat, then in vegan egg mixture, then in seasoned panko, so it’s fully coated.
In medium cast iron pan add oil so it’s between 1/4 & 1/2-inch deep and heat on medium heat, once hot begin to fry each piece for several minutes on each side until golden brown, when done let sit on newspaper or paper bag to catch excess oil.

NOTE: if you’re doing a big batch and allow to cool – pieces may be reheated before serving by assembling on a baking sheet and reheat in a 350-degree oven for 5 – 10 minutes until hot.

Homemade Seitan
For the coating – Flour:

2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp dried sage
2 tbsp paprika
2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
Kosher salt
1 cup all-purpose flour

½ tsp baking powder
For the buttermilk:
1 cup vegan buttermilk (1 cup of soya milk and 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, whisked together and left to sit for 5 – 10 mins)
1 tsp hot sauce
Pinch of salt
Oil for frying

","
Preparation
Make the seitan following the instructions below:

There are loads of recipes for seitan and I am working my way through them, learning as I go. For this recipe I tried one by Isa Chandra (Chicken Stylee Seitan, available on thePPK.com) and because it was a big batch I tried a couple of different ways of cooking it. I think either way would work and I would definitely try the boiled method for this recipe next time.


I followed the recipe by Isa Chandra up to the point of cooking. At that point, I separated the seitan dough in to two batches. With one, I followed the recipe, gentry cooking the seitan in stock. This was the most successful of my attempts so far. It is really, really important not to let it boil. I got all tech about it and dragged out the jam thermometer. I kept it between 94 and 98 degrees.


Anyway, for this particular version, I took the other half of the seitan and formed it in to small nuggets. Keep them on the small side because they will expand on cooking. I put them on an oiled baking tray and covered them with tin foil and baked for 20 – 30 mins at 180oC. Keep an eye on them, they are only small so it won’t take much to burn them. My thinking with this was that it keep them dry and therefore make the coating stick better.


If you have the time, the stock method would work too but you would want to leave them to drain for quite a while and get as much stock out of them as you can before trying to do the coating.


If you don’t fancy making your own seitan or you have your own preferred product or recipe, you could just use that. If you are still searching for that perfect recipe, give Isa’s recipe a go.


Method

You will need 2 bowls and a drying rack to complete all of the coating process and to also drain off the seitan once cooked.


Start off by making the vegan butter milk. Combine the ingredients and then let sit for 5 to 10 mins whilst you get all the ingredients for the flour together and mix them well in a bowl. By the time you have got them all sorted, your buttermilk should be good to go.


In your second bowl, mix the buttermilk with the hot sauce and salt. You are now ready to being the coating process.


Add the seitan to the buttermilk and let soak for 10 mins. One soaked, add the pieces a few at a time to the flour and coat well before putting on the drying rack and leaving for another 5 to 10 mins. You can use this time to get your oil heated up. You want it at 180oC. Be careful, don’t burn your house down or anything.


Once the seitan pieces have sat in the coating for 10 mins, we repeat the coating process. This helps more of the flour stick and also creates all sort of lumps, bumps and crevices which are going to make this really good. Straight in to the buttermilk, straight in to the flour and then in to the 180oC oil.


The most important tip I found was to leave the pieces along for at least 3 minutes otherwise you risk knocking the coating off. Overall mine took about 8 mins to get nice and golden. My pan was not big enough to cook the whole lot and yours probably won’t be either so I did a couple of batches and kept the first batch warm in a low oven. I chucked the first batch in the oil again for a minute at the end, just because.

Dressing: Start by mixing your dressing. In a small bowl combine tahini/mayo, vinegar, water and maple syrup. Set aside so the flavors come together. This can be made a day or two ahead and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use. Add a tad more water, or vinegar if you’re a vinegar lover, to thin out dressing as desired. If using vegan mayo, you may like to add 2 more tablespoons.
Mash chickpeas: In a medium to large bowl, add your garbanzo beans and roughly mash with a strong fork or potato masher. Mash at least 3/4 of the chickpeas so it binds well.
Assemble: Add in celery, cranberries, nuts, scallions, salt, pepper and dressing, mix well. Serve at room temp or let chill in the refrigerator for an hour before serving.
Serve: Serve on your favorite bread as a closed or open faced sandwich, or on a bed of leafy greens. You may even opt to simply enjoy the salad as is.
Serves 6
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days, in a covered container.

Tempeh Meatballs,"
Ingredients

4 tbsp olive oil
1 small white onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
100g chestnut mushrooms, finely sliced
1 block of tempeh, 200g
3 tbsp of soy sauce
2 tbsp of nutritional yeast
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup of cooked brown rice
1/3 cup of oat flour

","
Preparation

Add 2 tbsp of the oil to a large frying pan, then add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté on a medium heat for 5-8 minutes, until they start to caramelise.
Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for another 10 minutes, until they have shrunk in size and all the water has evaporated.
Crumble the Tiba Tempeh block, either using a knife or a food processor. You’re looking for a consistency that’s a bit like mince.
Add the tempeh “mince” to the pan along with the soy sauce and nutritional yeast or Marmite, if using. Cook for another 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.
Pour the mixture into a bowl and add the cooked brown rice and oat flour. Mix everything together until you have a fairly sticky mixture.
With wet hands, roll the mix into individual balls about the size of a golf ball. Repeat the process until you have used up all the mixture.
Heat up the remaining oil and fry the tempeh balls for a few minutes on each side, until slightly golden brown. You might need to cook them in batches.
Serve hot with your favourite tomato sauce and the pasta of your choice. Delicious.

Mighty Meatballs,"
Ingredients
For the ‘meatballs’
1 x 400g tinned red kidney beans (drained and rinsed)
1/2 red onion roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves
35g oats
30g walnuts
4 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
Small handful of fresh basil
For the sauce
1/2 red onion sliced
1 carrot diced
120ml vegan red wine
120ml vegetable stock
300g Tideford Organics Tomato & Basil Sauce (or similar)
Oil for frying
","
Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper unless you’re using a non stick tray.
Add the meatball ingredients to a food processor and process the ingredients together until the mixture reaches a rough consistency, ensuring some larger pieces remain. It’s really important you avoid processing the ingredients for too long, otherwise the meatballs will turn into a mush!
Take roughly a tbsp of the mixture in your hand and roll it into a ball, then place it on the baking tray. Repeat until all the mixture has been used up and you’re left with 12 balls.
Transfer the baking tray to the oven and bake the balls for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by first adding a little oil to a frying pan on a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the red onion and fry for 3 minutes. Then add the carrot and fry for a further 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Next, add the wine to the pan and simmer on a low heat for 5 minutes.
Then add the vegetable stock, sauce, and finally add the meatballs to the pan. Simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the sauce has started to thicken.
Remove the pan from the hob and serve. We recommend serving with mashed potato and a sprinkle of basil. Enjoy!

SPAGHETTI + ITALIAN VEGAN MEATBALLS,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




12 oz. pasta or 2 spaghetti squash
1 jar (25 oz.) marinara sauce (or pasta sauce of choice)

Bean Balls

1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water, for water saute
8 oz. mushrooms (about 8 oz), sliced (I used cremini)
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup walnuts or sunflower seeds, optional
1 can (15 oz) beans (cannellini, chickpeas, kidney or black beans), drained and rinsed
1 cup of oats (old fashioned or quick oats)
1 tablespoon Italian seasonings (sub with dried oregano, basil, thyme or a mixture of these)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
pinch of red pepper flakes, to taste
sea salt and pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Saute: In a skillet or pan, heat oil or water over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion and garlic, add saute for 5 minutes, adding the herbs during the last minute. Let cool for a few minutes.
Food processor: If using the nuts/seeds, place in food processor first and pulse until coarsely ground, and continue. Also, if using old fashioned oats place them in the with the nuts to chop them up a bit. Add the beans, sauteed veggies, oats. Pulse until just combined (don’t overmix or it’ll turn into a paste). Taste for seasoning adding anything extra you may like. I added in some fresh chopped basil I had on hand.
Shape vegan meatballs: Roll mixture into balls, about 1 1/2 – 2 inches, and place on a baking sheet. I was able to get 10 jumbo sized bean balls. You can easily make smaller balls, yielding 16 – 20.
Cook in 1 of 2 ways:

Bake: Place balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment or silicone mat. Put in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 25 – 30 minutes at 400 degrees F. If roasting spaghetti squash, add in while the squash is cooking. Remove both when time is up and let cool.
Stovetop: In a skillet or shallow pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat, add meatballs and cook for 15 – 20 minutes, turning often to brown all sides.

Cook sauce + meatballs: Add the pasta sauce and meatballs together, cook over low for 10 minutes, or until sauce is warmed through.
Pasta: Cook the pasta according to package directions. If using spaghetti squash, see How To Cook Spaghetti Squash
Serve: In individual bowls serve spaghetti topped with sauce and vegan meatballs. Top with salt, pepper, and chopped fresh parsley or basil. A nice dusting of Almond Parmesan will also enhance this dish!
Serves 4 – 6

Tempeh Sausage and Heirloom Tomatoes over Black Pepper Cheezy Polenta,"
Ingredients

Tempeh Sausage:
1 8oz package 3 grain tempeh
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 ½ teaspoons fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black peppercorns
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
¼ teaspoon celery seed
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
Dashes liquid smoke
1 clove garlic-minced
Black Pepper Cheezy Polenta:
4 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup corn meal
2 pinches crushed black peppercorns
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
Other Ingredients:
1/4 cup white wine
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 large red onion, diced small
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (we used heirloom cherry tomatoes, but you don’t have to)
1 red bell pepper, chopped into bite sized pieces
1 cup raw baby spinach leaves
5 large fresh basil leaves, cut small

","
Method

In a large bowl, toss all the ingredients for the tempeh sausage. Cover and let marinate while you make your polenta.
In a Dutch oven or another large pot, bring 4 cups of water, olive oil and salt to a boil. Gradually add your corn meal to the boiling water using a whisk to blend it in. Try to break up any clumps you see start to form. Once all your corn meal is added, whisk in your pepper and nutritional yeast. Then move to stirring your polenta with a wooden spoon, be sure to scrap the sides and bottom of the pot while you stir. You’re going to be stirring pretty much continually while your polenta thickens for about 40-45 minutes. Polenta is a needy dish.
Once your polenta is soft but firm – you’ll know what I mean, put a lid on top . Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in your deepest skillet over a medium heat. Once your oil is hot, toss in your tempeh sausage mix, white wine, liquid amino acids and onions, and cook while mixing with a spatula until your tempeh has slightly crispy edges. Then toss your tomatoes and bell peppers in and let them cook for about 5 minutes, flipping them every once in a while to make sure they’re cooking evenly. Once your peppers are tender, mix in your spinach and basil leaves. Once they’re wilted, you’re done!
Serve your tempeh sausage & heirloom tomatoes over your polenta – being sure to get some of the thin “sauce” on the bottom of the skillet.

Preparation
Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image: split-pin.co.uk

You can use gravy granules or make your own. I always make my own and you can find out how in my Vegan Roast Dinner recipe.


Method

If making your own gravy, you probably want to get started on that first. If using granules you can start on that about the same time as the broccoli
Wash and chop your potatoes (I always leave the skins on, even for mash, as there’s so much goodness there!), and add to a pan of water
Bring to boil and then keep on a medium heat until the potatoes are nice and soft
In the meantime, cook the sausages according to the instructions on the packet
Wash and cut your broccoli into florets and add to a pan of hot water. I like my broccoli crunchy and bright green so I only cook mine in boiling water for a few minutes before draining and serving
Drain your potatoes and mash with a little vegan marge, a little salt and heaps of cracked pepper
Plate up, pour over gravy and eat immediately!

Smoky Socca Tacos and Peach Salsa,"
Ingredients

For the socca:
200g chickpea/gram flour
300ml water
Olive oil for cooking – see note
For the hot filling:
1 chipotle chilli
1 tsp olive oil
1 red onion
4 cloves garlic
1 tin pinto beans (400g / drained weight 240g), rinsed and drained
1 medium tomato
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp smoked paprika
2 tsp good soy sauce or aminos
For the peach salsa:
1 avocado
4 saturn peaches or 1 regular peach
2 medium tomatoes
Juice of 1 lime (preferably organic)
Handful of fresh coriander stems & leaves
4 romaine or gem lettuce leaves

","
Method

Make the socca batter by sifting the chickpea flour into a bowl. Combine with the water by hand-whisking (using a fork is fine) to ensure there are no lumps and it’s nice and bubbly. Set aside.
Place the chipotle chilli in a bowl with boiling water and set aside.
To make the salsa, chop the avocado, peaches and tomatoes into small chunks and combine in a bowl with the lime juice and finely chopped coriander.
Cut the lettuce into fine ribbons and place in a bowl.
Remove the chipotle chilli from the water and remove the seeds and membrane (if you don’t do this your mouth will be on fire!). Finely chop the rest.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan while you chop the onion, garlic and tomato. Add these and the chipotle to the pan and cook until the onions become translucent – about 5 minutes. Add the cumin and paprika, give it a stir and then add the pinto beans. While this is cooking you can make the socca tacos.
Place a good, non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, adding a little oil if needed (see note). Once the pan is hot, spoon in some of the socca batter. I find a large serving spoon is about the right amount – making about 6 tortillas.
Wait for bubbles to appear in the batter. Once they have all popped, flip the tortilla over and allow the other side to cook – about 2 minutes on each side.
Pop them on a plate ready to serve.
The hot filling will also be ready by now, transfer this to a serving bowl.

I like to serve these by setting out all the dishes on the table for a DIY dinner – it’s much more fun!
NOTES: I recently acquired a ceramic frying pan which is perfect for this recipe. You can make pancakes – and everything else – without the need for a single drop of oil! If your pan is not super non-stick, use a little oil for the socca, as you would for regular pancakes. If you don’t want to be cooking the hot filling and the socca tortillas at the same time, make the tortillas first and set aside on a plate – they don’t need to be hot to serve. I’ve suggested using organic limes because not only do they taste great, but they are unwaxed (which is particularly important if you’re using the zest).

1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans) or 1 can (15oz.), drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon tamari
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika (regular or smoked)
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 – 2 tablespoons hot sauce (sriracha, Franks, Tapatio, etc.), or to taste

lime wedges, to serve


","

Instructions


Spiced Chickpeas: In a small pan, combine the chickpeas, garlic + onion powder, cumin, paprika, tamari, and as much hot sauce to suit your taste. Warm chickpea mixture over medium heat until warmed through. Alternatively, warm the chickpeas in the microwave, using a microwave safe bowl, for 45 – 60 seconds.
Warm the tortillas: I do this carefully on the stove top over an open flame to give it some charring on the edges. Stack them on top of each other to keep them warm, you can also place them in a tortilla warmer.
Assemble: Layer each tortilla with buffalo chickpeas, avocado, cabbage, green onions, cilantro, and drizzle of vegan crema.
Serves 3, two tacos per serving
Store: Leftover chickpea mixture can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days, in a covered container.

Taco Nut Meat

1 cup walnuts
1 cup mushrooms (I used baby bellas)
1 tablespoon tamari, soy sauce or coconut amino’s
1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder

Spanish Quinoa

1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water
1/2 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced (any color is ok), optional
1 – 2 cloves garlic, minced or 1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 tablespoon tomato paste or 1 cup diced tomatoes
2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water
salt + pepper, to taste

To Serve

6 corn tortillas or 6 leaves butter, romaine or other large leafy greens for raw taco wrap
Black Bean Corn Salad (use half recipe)
cilantro, to serve
lime wedges, to serve
pico de gallo (use pre-packaged for convenience), to serve
avocado slices, to serve
hot sauce – tapatio, sriracha or your favorite hot sauce, to serve (optional)


","

Instructions


Spanish quinoa (serves 6):

In medium size pan or skillet, heat oil over medium high heat, add onion, optional bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes, add quinoa and garlic, cook another 5 minutes or so stirring frequently until quinoa starts to get toasty and turn slightly golden. 
Add water, tomato paste, oregano, salt + pepper, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. 
When done, remove cover, fluff with the a fork, and let set for 15 minutes to absorb the rest of the liquids. Taste for seasonings before serving.

Nut meat (makes 6 tacos): 

Place all ingredients in food processor/blender and pulse until you have chunky crumbles. Don’t over process or you will have a nut mushroom pate, which wouldn’t be so bad but we want a crumbly effect here. For visual steps, see this Walnut Meat recipe.
Optionally, heat the nut meat on low just until warm in a small saucepan. You don’t want to overheat or the mushrooms will cook too much, just slightly warm it. I find both ways, warm and room temp, to be just as appealing. Makes enough for 6 tacos.

Warm your tortillas on the griddle or skillet for 30 seconds per side.
Serve: Put your plates and tacos together as you wish! You may find that you end up combining the black bean salsa with the Spanish fried quinoa. You may also find yourself making tacos out of both of those side dishes as well. However you craft your plate, enjoy!

1 (14 ounce) package non-gmo firm or extra-firm tofu, pressed
chipotle mayo or chipotle tahini sauce (recipe), to serve
pico de gallo, to serve (optional)
limes wedges, to serve
6 corn tortillas, to serve

Tofu Marinade

1/4 cup fresh lime juice, about 2 large limes
1 teaspoon cumin
pinch of mineral salt

Red Cabbage Slaw

1/2 small red cabbage, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons apple cider or red wine vinegar
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
pinch of mineral salt


","

Instructions


Press tofu: Drain tofu, place block on its side and cut in half lengthwise. With halves still together, place tofu flat and cut into thirds on its longest side. You will get six pieces. Place tofu between a double folded kitchen towel and add a heavy book or pot over top to remove excess moisture. Let sit while you prepare the marinade.
Marinate: In a small/medium size baking dish or pan (I used a loaf pan), mix together the lime juice, cumin and salt. Place tofu in mixture and marinate for at least 30 min, and up to 24 hours.
Cabbage slaw: In a medium size mixing bowl, add the cabbage, vinegar, cilantro and salt, mix well and give a toss every now and then. Let set at least 10 min. Making it ahead a day or two is also great!
Grill tofu: Heat grill over medium to medium-high heat. Add enough oil to generously coat the side of the griddle you’ll be using, about two tablespoons. Add a drop of water to the griddle, if it sizzles it’s ready. Place tofu on griddle, cook 3 – 4 minutes per side, or until you get nice grill marks. It helps to press the tofu with the back of a spatula to release excess liquids and aid in grill marks. Once done, set aside.
Serve: Warm tortillas over medium-low heat on a gas or electric burner. Layer each tortilla with on piece tofu, red cabbage slaw and chipotle sauce. Top with optional pico de gallo and a squeeze of lime.
Serves 2 – 3
NOTES:
Don’t be shy with the toppings. Pile them as high as you like!

ROASTED POBLANO TACOS,"


Ingredients



Scale

2 medium poblano chiles (Anaheim or hatch chilies ok too)
1 can (15 oz) pinto, black beans or refried beans
2 scallions, sliced
purple or green cabbage, shredded
avocado, sliced
cilantro
6 corn tortillas (or 9 organic corn tortilla sliders)
lime wedges, to serve
hatch chile cashew dressing or cilantro lime cashew cream, to serve


","

Instructions


Roast poblanos: Turn broiler to medium – high, place poblanos on baking sheet and place under the broiler for about 7 – 10 minutes, turning every few minutes to char and brown evenly on all sides. Poblanos will crackle and pop while cooking, they will be ready when charred and softened to the touch of a fork pushing on its side. Place poblanos in a bowl, cover with a plate or saran wrap and let steam for a few minutes (this will help loosen the skin for peeling). Remove the skin, lay the peeled poblano on a flat surface, remove the top and make a slit down the center, open and remove the seeds. Slice lengthwise into 1/2 inch strips.
Heat beans: Place beans in a small pot and cook over medium until warm, stirring occasionally. If using pinto or black beans, add a dash or two of garlic powder for a little extra flavor. You may decide to not heat your canned whole beans in which case, drain and rinse before using.
Prep veggies: Prepare scallions, purple cabbage and avocado. Heat your tortillas over the gas/electric burner until slightly charred.
Build: Layer your tacos with beans, poblanos, cabbage, scallions, avocado, cilantro and a sprinkle of pink salt & drizzle of cashew cream of choice or sriracha (or both!).

1 tablespoon water or 1/4 cup water for water saute
1 small onion, diced
1 small jalapeno, seeds removed and diced, optioanal
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

corn or flour tortillas, warmed
romain or lettuce, shredded
Pico de Gallo, Corn Salsa, and/or Mango Salsa
avocado, sliced
chopped cilantro
lime wedges
vegan cheese (my favorite is Miyoko’s Mozz, crumbled)


","

Instructions


Black Beans: In a medium pot, warm oil over medium heat, add the onions and saute for 5 minutes. Add the jalapeno, cumin, oregano, garlic powder and pinch of salt, cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until nice and fragrant. Add the beans, and 1/4 cup of water, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 – 8 minutes. Remove from heat, smash at least 1/2 of the beans, using the back of a slotted spoon or fork. Add the remaining water as needed for desired consistency. If you add too much water, the beans will thicken upon standing. Taste for flavor adding more salt as needed.
Warm the tortillas: I love to warm my tortillas over a medium-low flame of the stovetop burner, flipping them often until they are lightly charred around the edges.
Assemble: Lay the tortilla on a flat surface, top with 1/4 cup of the beans, small handful of leafy greens, pico de gallo and/or corn salsa, sliced avocado, and crumbled cheese (optional). Add a sprinkle of salt and squeeze of lime overtop.
Makes about 10 tacos, 2 tacos per serving.
Store in the refrigerator or freezer: Keep leftover black beans in the refrigerator 4 – 5 days, stored in covered containers. For longer storage, keep in the freezer for 2 – 3 months in freezer safe containers. Let thaw before reheating.
To Reheat: Warm the beans on the stove over low, stirring occasionally, until warmed through. Alternately, place them in the microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring each time, until warmed.
NOTES:
These Instant Pot Black Beans made from scratch using dried beans would be great too!
For creaminess, try adding a dollop of Vegan Sour Cream or Sriracha Cashew Cream.

Chilli Vegetable Pizza,"
Ingredients

125g ’00’ flour
125g strong wholemeal flour
1/2 tsp dried active yeast*
4g dried chipotle mora chilli
very finely diced
5g Himalayan pink salt (or table salt)
150ml warm water
12 cherry tomatoes
1/2 red onion
1 large clove garlic
7g ancho poblano chilli
soaked with seeds
1/2 cup water
2 tblsps balsamic vinegar

","
Preparation
Makes 2 individual 8″ pizzas
Equipment

Food processor with dough blade
Pizza stone or tray
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Frying pan


Method
Add all of the flours, yeast*, salt and chipotle mora to the food processor with the dough blade and turn on.
*I only had dried active yeast to hand, so added it to the ingredients above, (ignoring the actual instructions on the container) with full success!
Pour the water in a steady trickle until you’ve used it all and the dough becomes a ball.
Take the dough out of the processor, lightly flour your surface and set the timer for 10 mins. Knead and stretch the dough the whole time – if your arms start to ache, just image the amazing workout you’re giving them without stepping inside a gym!
Once the timer goes off, shape into a ball, put into a deep bowl that’s had a light sprinkling of flour on the bottom, cover with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Once rested, take it out of the bowl and knead again for 10 seconds – this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten.
Divide into 2 equally sized, smooth balls of dough and put into a deep baking dish, lightly sprinkled with flour. Make sure the dish is big enough for them to spread up to twice their size because as the gluten relaxes, they will spread to some degree.
* Top Tip *
I’ve made this base numerous times and sometimes the dough spreads a lot, other times it hardly spreads at all. Don’t worry, it’s always tasted great either way!
Leave to rest at room temperature overnight, or if you’re in a massive hurry, at least eight hours! I don’t leave mine in a very warm place like the airing cupboard as I found it can dry out and form a ‘skin’ on the outside.
* Top Tip *
The resting time for the dough is ideally 24 hours, but 48 hours is maximum.
Put the normal blade back into your food processor and add in the tomatoes, onion, garlic and ancho poblano, pulse for 10-20 seconds to break them up into small chunks, and pour into your frying pan.
* Top Tip *
You can choose how chunky or smooth to have the sauce when pulsing in the processor. Personally I prefer it chunky as it almost becomes one of the delicious pizza toppings.
Add the water, balsamic and simmer on a medium heat for 12-15 mins to let the flavours intensify, while stirring occasionally. It’s ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist; don’t let it dry out and stick to the pan.
* Top Tip *
The sauce flavours will develop the longer you leave it, so why not make it a couple of days in advance and keep in the fridge? It does however, also tastes great if you make it on the day.
Turn the oven on to the highest setting to heat up your pizza stone if you have one, otherwise 220c if you’re using a pizza tray.
* Top Tip *
For pizza stones, it’s always the hotter the better, so I usually pre-heat mine for an hour.
Lightly flour your surface, roll out the dough, add sauce and your favourite tasty toppings. Put into the oven for approx. 8 mins on the pizza stone. I haven’t cooked them on a pizza tray before, but as it won’t have the intense heat of the stone, I’d suggest 10-12 mins (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t overcook on top).
* Serving Suggestion *
These chilli pizzas are a spicy alternative to your usual takeaway version – the base has a delicious hot and smokey bite to it, yet this is balanced perfectly by the sweet flavours of the tomato sauce. Throw a pizza party and impress your friends with your cooking skills, or snuggle up on the sofa with your loved one and enjoy all to yourselves!
I honestly don’t miss cheese on pizza once I throw on a mix of veggies, Dee’s vegan sausage and lots of hot, sweet roquito peppers – what’s on your list of ultimate pizza toppings?

Charred Mushroom and Cashew Pizza,"
Ingredients
FOR THE PIZZA:
300g light spelt flour
150ml tepid water
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for cooking
8 tablespoons good tomato passata
A handful of small black olives, de-stoned
A small handful of rocket
FOR THE MUSHROOMS:
1 red onion
Olive oil
250g mushrooms
1 clove of garlic
A few sprigs of fresh thyme
FOR THE CASHEW RICOTTA:
200g cashews
The juice of ½ an unwaxed lemon
1 clove of garlic
A pinch of fennel seeds
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)
","
Preparation
Makes 2 Large Pizzas.

Method

First, get all your ingredients together and find yourself a large heavy based frying pan – you’ll need it to be around 26cm. Preheat your grill to maximum.


Slice the red onion and put it into the frying pan with a little oil. Tear the mushrooms into pieces and roughly chop the garlic, then add to the pan with the thyme leaves and cook for 4–5 minutes, turning every so often, until the mushrooms are charred and crispy and cooked through. Remove and put aside for later.


Next, make the cashew ricotta: put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor with 3 tablespoons of cold water and blend until completely smooth – this should take 2–5 minutes, depending on how powerful your machine is. It should be the consistency of normal ricotta. Scoop out into a bowl and wash the processor bowl.


Now make the dough. Put the four and water into the processor with a good pinch of salt and a tablespoon of olive oil and pulse until the dough comes together in a ball. Tip it out and bring it together in your hands.


Get your frying pan on a medium to high heat. If you have two pans about the right size you can do both the pizzas at once, otherwise you can do one after the other, as they cook quickly.


Cut the dough into two equal halves and cover one half for later.


Put the other half on to a floured work surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 1cm thick circle about the size of your frying pan.


Drizzle a little oil into the hot pan, then carefully lift in the dough. Leave it on the heat for about 3 minutes, so the base is starting to cook, while you quickly top the pizza.


Spoon half the tomato passata over, then the mushrooms. Dot with the cashew cheese and the olives.


Pop the pizza under the grill for 4–5 minutes, until it is cooked through and the cashew cheese is browned.


Repeat with the second pizza.


To finish, strew with some rocket leaves and cut into generous slices.

Homemade Vegan Pizza/Nacho Cheese,"
Ingredients

1 x large potato
1 x large carrot
(3 tablespoons of the potato/carrot water)
1/2 cup of oil (I use olive)
1/2 cup of nutritional yeast
Juice of half a lemon
Teaspoon of garlic granules
Dash of celery salt
Cracked pepper

","
Preparation
This is the same cheese recipe featured in my Cheese on Toast, just in another guise. 

Method
There are lots of recipes for potato cheese out there, but this is the one I have adapted from various different ones*.

Peel one large potato and one large carrot
Chop into small chunks (carrot smaller than the potato as it is harder)
Boil until soft
Put 3 tablespoons of the potato water into a food processor
Drain potatoes and carrots and pour into the processor
Add: 1/2 cup of oil (I use olive), 1/2 cup of nutritional yeast, juice of half a lemon, teaspoon of garlic granules, dash of celery salt, cracked pepper
Blend!
You can eat this cheese straight away with tortilla chips, pour over nachos (maybe chuck it in the oven for a bit to make sure the cheese is really warm) or use as your cheese topping on pizza… Spread as liberally as you like! Sometimes you feel like more or less cheese, depending on your mood and/or the pizza toppings. The photos above are both with the same cheese… Just lots more on one that the other.
When cooked to your liking, remove and eat!

*According to everything I’ve read, this cheese can last up to 7 days in the fridge. Mine has never hung around that long, so I would say use within a couple of days to be on the safe side.

","
Preparation
Make the easy pizza tomato sauce: 
Finely chop one onion and a couple of cloves of garlic. Add to a frying pan with a little olive oil.
Add half a teaspoon (each) of oregano, basil and thyme and mix.
Add a can of chopped tomatoes, a little salt and cracked pepper and leave to simmer and thicken. If you don’t let the sauce thicken enough, your toppings can all slide off when eating. So this is why you need a little time to make the sauce. You don’t want it in any way watery.

Method
Assemble your pizza:

Make tomato sauce or use a base with sauce already added.
Preheat your oven to 220C.
Wash some kale and add it to a frying pan with a little olive oil. Sauté for a few minutes until the kale is dark green. Turn off heat.
Chop the rest of your ingredients and grate the cheese.
Create your pizza! Add sauce, kale, olives, mushrooms, pepper, tomato and, lastly (after 5/10 minutes in the oven) cheese – but you can really do any order you want.
Remove and eat in great big slices!

1 large beetroot, peeled & sliced
2 red onions
1 1/2 red pepper
1 medium sweet potato
100g Basil pesto tofu (available in supermarkets), sliced
3-4 tbsp nutritional yeast

","
Method
 

Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and cut into chunks. Then using a blender or food processor, blitz the cauliflower until it is finely chopped so that it resembles rice, i.e. cauliflower crumb


Transfer the crumb into a steamer and steam for 15 mins or microwave in a bowl with cling-film (with a hole or two on top) for 6 mins until soft


Preheat the oven to 200ºC (180ºC fan). Line 2 large baking sheets with greaseproof paper and a little coconut spray oil


Allow the cooked cauliflower crumb to cool before transferring into a clean tea towel and squeezing as much moisture as you can out. (Really wring it!) You may need more than one tea towel


Transfer the dehydrated cauliflower crumb into a bowl and add the remaining pizza base ingredients: ground chia seeds, protein powder (I used Pulsin Soya Protein powder), ground almonds, nutritional yeast, chia egg substitute, dried mixed herbs, a large pinch of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper


Using your hands, divide the pizza mixture in half and place directly on each baking sheet. Shape into a ball and then press down to form a round pizza base shape


Bake for 15 mins until the bases are golden brown and starting to crisp a little at the edges. If you want your base extra crispy, half-way through baking, flip it over to ensure both sides are well baked


Whilst the base is baking, mix together the ground flaxseed, sugar-free apple sauce, tomato purée, tamari, dried oregano, garlic and season with salt and pepper


Spread the tomato topping onto each of the pizza bases


Then top your pizza with your topping of choice. I Have chosen roasted vegetables and slices of basil pesto tofu. Sprinkle over with nutritional yeast


Turn the oven up to 240ºC (220ºC fan) and bake for a further 12- 15 mins


I love to serve mine with a large handful of fresh rocket on top and a side salad. Enjoy!

The key to making a great cauliflower crust pizza is by making a cauliflower crumb and then dehydrating it, so that as much moisture is squeezed out as possible, allowing the remaining crumb to be turned into a crispy pizza base. (If you don’t squeeze out the moisture, the base will be all soggy). You will be surprised with the amount of liquid which comes out! But this delicious grain-free pizza is well worth the effort.
There are two ways you can dehydrate your cauliflower crumb: the more time-consuming method is by putting the cooked cauliflower crumb in a tea-towel or two and wringing out the moisture. (I think of this as stress relief!). Alternatively, if you are lucky enough to have a juicer, you can simply feed cauliflower florets through the juicer and collect the residual crumb and mix this directly with the remaining pizza base ingredients. (No need to cook before using!).
So why not give this recipe a go, to create a delicious vegan pizza chock full of vegetables!

Ingredients

25 g Flora Freedom
125 g self-raising wholemeal flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
7 tablespoons soya milk
50 g sundried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped

Gluten Free Pizza with Springtime Veg,"
Ingredients

1c gram flour
1c water
1/2t salt
300g Passata
1T nutritional yeast
1 garlic clove
Basil leaves
1/2 fennel bulb
Few asparagus
1 leek
1 courgette
Few mushrooms
Olive oil

","
Method

In a jug mix the flour, water and salt with a fork. Leave to rest for a few minutes.


Put a baking sheet on a large baking tray. Pour the flour mixture onto the paper, try to make it a round pizza shape but it’s not a problem if you can’t.


Put this in the oven whilst you prepare the toppings. This should take 10-15 minutes, the edges will be starting to brown.


In a bowl mix the passata with the nutritional yeast. Grate the garlic i to this, shred or tear the basil and add that too.


Using your peeler shred the fennel, just a handful will suffice. Put into a large bowl.


Chop about 2 inches off the bottom end of the asparagus. Roughly chop at a diagonal angle. Add to the bowl.


Finely slice the leek. Add to the bowl.


Cut the top and bottom off the courgettes. Using the peeler shred into wide thin pieces. Add to the bowl.


Finely slice the mushrooms but do not put these in the bowl yet.


Add a splash of olive oil and a dash of salt to the bowl. Using your hands mix this well and massage the oil into the veg. Now add the mushrooms and mix just a little.


Take your base out of the oven if you haven’t already. Turn the oven up to 240c.


Top with the passata, use however much you want, some people like a lot and some people like a little, it’s up to you.


Top with the veg.


Put the pizza on the top shelf of the oven. After 10 minutes check the pizza, the veg should be starting to brown, bake more if needed.

Scale
1x2x3x 




1 prepared pizza dough or pizza dough recipe
1/3 cup pizza or marinara sauce
1 tomato, thinly sliced
1 can artichoke hearts, sliced
1/3 cup black or green olives, halved
3/4 cup cooked chickpeas
1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced
pinch of red pepper flakes, optional
6 – 7 large basil leaves, julienned
almond parmesan, to serve


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place pizza stone or large baking sheet into the oven while oven heats.
Prep the dough: Let dough come to room temperature. Lightly flour a cutting board or flat workstation, gently stretch with your hands and roll out into a 12 inch pizza round. Be patient with the dough, it will want to shrink back (this is because of the gluten) but keep going you’ll get it to stay in place soon enough. Place dough on a good size piece of parchment paper, this is the easiest way to transfer the dough. 
Par-bake dough: Once oven is ready, place dough on baking sheet and bake on the center rack for 7 – 10 minutes.
Layer pizza: Carefully remove pizza dough from the oven and layer starting with the sauce, then the tomato slices, artichokes, olives, chickpeas and finally the red onion. Give a good sprinkle of red pepper flakes and mineral salt. 
Bake: Place pizza back in the oven for an additional 10 – 15 minutes. Let cool a few minutes.
To serve: Add basil or arugula over top. Cut into 4, 6 or 8 slices. Serve warm with a sprinkle of almond parmesan.

mineral salt & cracked pepper to taste


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.
Let dough rest: Coat an 8 or 10 inch cast iron skillet with olive oil. Remove dough from refrigerator, open package and place dough in center of the skillet, cover skillet with a clean dish towel. Let set for 30 minutes.
Roast veggies: Prep the mushrooms, zucchini, bell pepper and onion. Place on a rimmed baking sheet, along with the tomatoes for the sauce, drizzle with olive oil and gently toss to coat, keeping the tomatoes together. Sprinkle with salt. Place in the oven on the middle rack for 15 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Pre-bake dough: Remove dish towel for skillet and gently flatten out dough, pushing up the edges about 1 – 1/2 inches. Place in oven on middle rack and bake for 10 minutes.
Make sauce: While dough is pre-cooking, add the warm tomatoes, and remaining ingredients for the balsamic tomato sauce to a food processor or blender and process until blended and fairly smooth. Taste for flavor adding anything extra you might like.
Bake pizza: Remove dough from the oven, layer with 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce and reserved roasted vegetables. Place in oven and bake for 15 minutes, until crust is golden. Remove from oven and let cool a few minutes before cutting to serve.
Serve with red pepper flakes and a good dusting of almond parmesan.
NOTES:
If your crust doesn’t become golden enough for you, place the skillet pizza under the broiler for a minute or so checking often so it doesn’t burn.
I would love to recommend a good pizza dough recipe but I haven’t made one yet and find the ready made dough is quick and works great for me. If you have a good whole wheat pizza dough recipe I’d love know about it!

Tofu Scramble Breakfast Burritos,"
Ingredients

1 x block of firm tofu
Olive or rapeseed oil
1 x onion
2/3 garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon of thyme
A good shake of paprika
1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric
1/2 tablespoons soy/tamari sauce
Optional: mushrooms, peppers, chili, red and yellow pepper etc.
2-3 tablespoons of nutritional yeast
Black pepper and salt to taste
Tortilla wraps
Garnish options:
Tomato salsa
Hot sauce
Jalapenos
Spring onions
Grated vegan cheese
Avocados

","
Preparation
This recipe uses a whole block of tofu so makes a healthy serving of scramble. How many burritos you have will be determined by how much you pack into each, and how large your tortilla wraps are… But you should have four large burritos if you make them according to the recipe below.

Method

Rinse the tofu, wrap it in a clean tea towel, then put something heavy on top (some books, perhaps) to press the liquid from it.
Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Add these to a frying pan with a splash of olive oil.
Cook for a bit and then add the thyme,  paprika and turmeric. Mix and then add the soy sauce.
Add any other veg you want to include and stir.
Now, take the books off the tofu and give the tea towel another squeeze. Then with your hands, crumble the tofu into the frying pan.
Mix the tofu through, using your spoon to break up any bigger bits. It should look similar to scrambled egg now.
Once all mixed in, add nutritional yeast and mix in. I am obsessed with nutritional yeast so I always add more than 2!
Add some pepper and mix again.
Leave to cook for another 20 mins or so, turning down the heat a little to stop it sticking. Give it a stir occasionally.
After about 20 minutes you can start to prep your tortilla wraps. Spread some tomato salsa in the middle of the wrap. Add sliced avocado or a little homemade guacamole on top, and then sprinkle on some grated vegan cheese. Then pile some scramble on top of the cheese and add sliced spring onions and jalapenos on top.
Wrap up and serve with extra avocado and Frank’s hot sauce.

BLACK BEAN + QUINOA BURRITOS (VEGAN FREEZER BURRITOS),"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1/2 cup dried quinoa
3/4 cup + 1 or 2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water (for water saute)
1/2 large red onion, diced
1 orange bell pepper, seeds removed and diced
1 can (14oz) diced tomatoes, drained (or 2 roma tomatoes, seeds removed and diced)
1 medium zucchini, diced
2 cans (14 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
1 can (14 oz) corn, drained
1/4 – 1/2 cup cilantro, roughly chopped
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
3/4 – 1 teaspoon chipotle powder or 2 – 4 chipotles in adobe sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
mineral salt, to taste
6 – 8 medium/large tortillas

to serve

sliced avocado
salsa of choice


","

Instructions


Quinoa: In a small/medium pot, combine the quinoa and water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 13 minutes. Remove lid, let set 10 minutes, fluff with a fork. Set aside.
Filling: In a large pan or pot, heat oil/water over medium heat, add onion and saute for 4 minutes, add bell pepper and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, zucchini and corn, cook another 3 minutes or so (cook veggies until they are as soft as you like, I prefer mine to be a little al dente). Add the black beans, quinoa, cilantro, cumin, chipotle, garlic & onion powder, and salt, continue to cook until heated through.
Roll: Place tortillas on a flat surface, place a mound of the filling in the center, leaving room all the way around, fold in half, fold up each end, and roll the burrito away from you to completely close it.
Freeze: I try to avoid foil, so here I used paper sandwich bags. Feel free to use foil, freezer paper, saran wrap, plastic freezer ziploc bags or whatever you’re used to freezing with. If using the paper sandwich bags, they should be eaten within a few weeks to avoid freezer burn. Most likely they won’t be around that long!
Reheat: If at room temperature, warm in the oven/toaster oven at 375 degrees F for 10 minutes or so, or microwave for 30 seconds. If frozen heat in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, or microwave for 1:30 – 2 minutes.
Serve with sliced avocado and your favorite salsa (I paired mine with a hatch chili salsa). You may also like to pair it with any of these condiments: Cashew Sour Cream, Cilantro-Lime Cashew Cream, Chipotle Tahini Dressing, Cumin-Lime Tahini Dressing, Pico de Gallo, or Homemade Guacamole.
Enjoy these flavorful vegan freezer burritos!

BBQ Tofu Wings and Ranch,"
Ingredients

For the tofu:
1 block (250-300g) firm tofu
2 tbsp gram flour + 3 tbsp water
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried onion granules
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp cayenne pepper
For the BBQ sauce:
1 tin tomatoes (400g), puréed
2 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp good soy sauce
Juice of ½ an orange
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried chilli flakes (or cayenne pepper)
Black pepper
For the ranch:
2 tbsp tahini
4 tbsp water
Handful of fresh dill leaves (about 10g)
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp lemon juice
½ tsp dijon mustard
½ tsp vinegar (apple cider, red wine)
1 tsp dried marjoram or oregano
Pinch cayenne pepper

","
Preparation
THE DAY BEFORE: cut the block of tofu into 5 slices, each about 1 cm thick, then cut each slice in half again so you have 10 pieces. Place between sheets of kitchen paper on a plate and freeze. Remove from the freezer a couple of hours before you want to start cooking, in order to defrost.

Method

Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Once the tofu has defrosted, press between sheets of kitchen paper until most of the water has gone (you can do this using a heavy book). You don’t want the tofu to be so dry that it crumbles, but just to remove most of the water.
Combine the ingredients for the tofu coating ‘batter’ in a bowl.
Dip each tofu wing into the batter to fully coat and place on a non-stick baking tray, greased with a little oil if needed.
Place on the top shelf of the oven and cook for 30 minutes, turning once half way through.
Next, put the BBQ sauce on to simmer. Combine all the ingredients and cook on a medium heat on the hob, covering with a lid once it starts to bubble and spit. You want a thick sauce, so simmer for 20-30 minutes.
While the wings and BBQ sauce are cooking, make the ranch. Put all the ingredients into a food processor and blitz until smooth.
Once the wings have been cooking for 30 minutes, remove from the oven. Carefully place each one in the BBQ sauce, coat using a spoon, then place back onto the baking tray.
Cook for a further 10 minutes, arrange on a plate with the ranch and serve!

NOTES: Freezing the tofu isn’t essential, but it leads to a chewier texture. If you’re not freezing it, drain and press for a little longer, ensuring as much water is squeezed out as possible.

Tempeh Bolognese,"
Ingredients
For the Bolognese sauce
250g tempeh
250g field mushrooms or any other is fine
1 stick celery finely chopped
1 medium carrot finely chopped
1 onion finely chopped
4 cloves garlic
20g tomato puree
200ml red wine
1 canned chopped tomatoes or 400g
300ml passata
100ml water
Few sprigs rosemary and thyme finely chopped
","
Method

Start to pulse the mushrooms as they need to be pureed. Remove and place into a bowl.
Do the same to the tempeh, but this needs to be a bit chunkier. Place it in with the mushrooms.
Add the mushroom and tempeh into the pan, turn the heat up to cook out the mushroom water. This will do two things: give a deep colour and intensify the flavours.
Once the mushroom water has been cooked out and evaporated, transfer the mix out of the pan and drain in the colander.
In the same large pan, add some olive oil. Add the finely chopped veggies and cook slowly, releasing all those beautiful aromas and flavours. Then in with the garlic and cook for a further 2-3mins.
Add the finely chopped thyme and rosemary and continue to cook for a few minutes.
Go in with the tomato puree, cook out slowly for 3 mins. Finely add the red wine and turn the heat up to deglaze the pan with all the caramelized sediment that’s on the bottom of the pan – this is where all the natural flavour is.
Reduce to cook out the alcohol and add the tempeh and mushroom mixture back into the pan. Give the mix a good stir.
Add the canned tomatoes, passata and water. Give it a good stir.
Season with salt and pepper cook for 10 mins.
Have a pan of boiling water ready to cook the pasta. Mix and emulsify the Bolognese sauce with the cooked pasta.
Finish with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.
Serve and enjoy!

1 × 400g (14 oz.) bag of kale or spinach
Vegan Parmesan cheese (optional)

","
Preparation
Serves 4 Generously.
The key to this recipe is to measure your water carefully and to use the right pan: you need a large shallow sauté pan or a casserole large enough to fit the pasta lying down.
A large deep frying pan or wok would work well too.

Method

Fill and boil a kettle and get all your ingredients and equipment together. You need a large shallow pan with a lid.


Put the pasta into the pan.


Quickly and roughly chop the tomatoes in half and throw them into the pan.


Grate in the zest of both lemons and add the oil and salt.


Add 1 litre of boiling water, put a lid on the pan and bring to the boil. As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the lid and simmer on a high heat for 6 minutes, using a pair of tongs to turn the pasta every 30 seconds or so as it cooks.


Meanwhile, remove any tough stalks from the kale or spinach and roughly tear the leaves.


Once the pasta has had 6 minutes, add the kale and continue to cook for a further 2 minutes.


Once almost all the water has evaporated, take the pan off the heat and tangle into four bowls.


If you like, top with a little vegan Parmesan.

",Spaghetti
Spaghetti with Sicilian Pesto,"
Ingredients

2 cloves of garlic
A bunch of fresh basil (use just the leaves and NOT the stalks)
60g salted capers (soaked and rinsed)
80g blanched almonds
Half a chilli
500g ripe cherry tomatoes
A handful of fine bread crumbs
8 tbsps of very good quality EVOO (extra virgin olive oil),  recommend Filippo Berio Gran Cru Sicilian Oil “monti Iblei” 

","
Method

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti (I use Garofalo) al dente.
In the meantime, blanch the tomatoes in boiling water until the skin breaks – immediately remove them from the boiling water, and plunge them into cold (I do mine in the kitchen sink!).
Remove the seeds and skin and cut the tomatoes into quarters.
In a food processor place the rinsed and dried capers, almonds, garlic, basil and chilli and blitz to a fine paste. To achieve a smooth finish of the pesto add 4 of the 8 tbsps. of  EVOO.
When the pasta is cooked, in a large pan place the diced tomatoes, the pesto and warm through at low heat, add the pasta, stir well and (to add some crunchiness) sprinkle some bread crumbs.
Serve immediately. Wonderful!

",Spaghetti
Aubergine and Sage Spaghetti Marinara,"
Ingredients

2 tsp olive oil
1 aubergine (eggplant)
100g wild mushrooms (or other variety e.g. chestnut)
6 cloves garlic
10 fresh sage leaves
150g wholewheat or spelt spaghetti plus water for cooking
1 jar / 500ml Spicy Marinara Sauce (recipe link under preparation)
2 tbsp Pumpkin Seed and Sun Dried Tomato Pesto (recipe link under preparation)
Optional: fresh basil leaves to garnish

","
Preparation
Please click for Marinara Sauce recipe
Please click for Pumpkin Seed and Sun Dried Tomato Pesto recipe

Method

On a medium to high heat, warm 1 tsp of the olive oil in a large, non-stick pan. Slice the mushrooms and the garlic and add these to the pan.
While the mushrooms and garlic are sautéing, chop the aubergine into cubes no larger than 1cm. Add the second tsp of oil and the aubergine cubes to the pan and give it a good stir.
Cook for about 10 minutes, until the aubergine cubes are lightly browned and soft. Roughly chop the sage leaves and add these too.
Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the spaghetti.
You can now stir the marinara sauce into the pan with the aubergines and lower the heat, so it can bubble away while the spaghetti cooks.
Around 5 minutes before the pasta is ready spoon some of the pasta cooking water into the sauce until you have a consistency you’re happy with. The aubergines suck up a lot of the sauce, so this helps to loosen it all up again.
Once the spaghetti is ready drain it and add it to the sauce. Give it all a nice stir and spoon into bowls. To serve, dot the pesto around the bowl and sprinkle on some fresh basil.

SPAGHETTI + ITALIAN VEGAN MEATBALLS,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




12 oz. pasta or 2 spaghetti squash
1 jar (25 oz.) marinara sauce (or pasta sauce of choice)

Bean Balls

1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water, for water saute
8 oz. mushrooms (about 8 oz), sliced (I used cremini)
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup walnuts or sunflower seeds, optional
1 can (15 oz) beans (cannellini, chickpeas, kidney or black beans), drained and rinsed
1 cup of oats (old fashioned or quick oats)
1 tablespoon Italian seasonings (sub with dried oregano, basil, thyme or a mixture of these)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
pinch of red pepper flakes, to taste
sea salt and pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Saute: In a skillet or pan, heat oil or water over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion and garlic, add saute for 5 minutes, adding the herbs during the last minute. Let cool for a few minutes.
Food processor: If using the nuts/seeds, place in food processor first and pulse until coarsely ground, and continue. Also, if using old fashioned oats place them in the with the nuts to chop them up a bit. Add the beans, sauteed veggies, oats. Pulse until just combined (don’t overmix or it’ll turn into a paste). Taste for seasoning adding anything extra you may like. I added in some fresh chopped basil I had on hand.
Shape vegan meatballs: Roll mixture into balls, about 1 1/2 – 2 inches, and place on a baking sheet. I was able to get 10 jumbo sized bean balls. You can easily make smaller balls, yielding 16 – 20.
Cook in 1 of 2 ways:

Bake: Place balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment or silicone mat. Put in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 25 – 30 minutes at 400 degrees F. If roasting spaghetti squash, add in while the squash is cooking. Remove both when time is up and let cool.
Stovetop: In a skillet or shallow pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat, add meatballs and cook for 15 – 20 minutes, turning often to brown all sides.

Cook sauce + meatballs: Add the pasta sauce and meatballs together, cook over low for 10 minutes, or until sauce is warmed through.
Pasta: Cook the pasta according to package directions. If using spaghetti squash, see How To Cook Spaghetti Squash
Serve: In individual bowls serve spaghetti topped with sauce and vegan meatballs. Top with salt, pepper, and chopped fresh parsley or basil. A nice dusting of Almond Parmesan will also enhance this dish!
Serves 4 – 6

Instructions


Guacamole: Cut avocados in half lengthwise, remove seed and using a spoon scoop out the flesh, place in medium size bowl. Using a fork cut the halves into large chunks and mash about 1/3 – 1/2. Add diced jalapeno, onion, tomatoes, mineral salt and lime juice. Mix to incorporate. Add in chopped cilantro and mix again gently. TIP: To keep your guacamole from browning, pack your guacamole well, add about 1/4 – 1/2 inch water over top and place in the fridge. When ready to serve, drain water, mix and serve. This will keep air away preventing oxidation.

1–2 Tbsp lemon zest
Pinch of salt
All the fixins:
Cucumber, thinly sliced
Cherry tomatoes halved
Parsley
Arugula (rocket)
Warm pitta breads

","
Method

Get a pan ripping hot and add a little oil. Place mushrooms, stem facing down, on a baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Place mushrooms, stem facing up, onto the hot pan, and add another pan on top for the pressing step.
Allow the weight of the pan to press them gently and apply gentle pressure using a tea towel once softened (you want them to soften, before properly pressing them, otherwise they break). As soon as you start to see water being released, start to apply more pressure. Turn and press on the other side, until they are half the size of the raw mushroom. (The whole pressing process will take between 8-10 minutes). Repeat for remaining mushrooms until caramelized on edges.
Combine all spices and seasonings in a small bowl and coat the stem side of the mushroom with the blend. Flip over and repeat, coating with the spices. Use a spoon to push the seasoning into the surface of the mushrooms.
Heat up a pan on medium heat and coat surface liberally with vegan butter. Saute mushrooms in a pan and blacken on both sides.
Make Tzatziki; Mix plain yoghurt, mint, garlic clove (crushed and finely chopped), lemon zest, and salt in a bowl.
Prep your side vegetables, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh parsley
Remove mushrooms from the pan and chop into thin slices, reminiscent of kebab meat.
Warm pitta bread in the oven and wrap in a tea towel, assemble your shawarma on a plate, topped with Tzatziki, arugula, mushrooms, tomatoes, sliced cucumber, parsley, and harissa.

1 onion, finely sliced half-moons				
10 fresh shitake mushrooms, finely sliced or dried shitake mushrooms	
½ block of tofu cut into (small dice)

1 head curly kale, stem removed and thinly sliced	
3 Tbsp tamari or shoyu (organic soya sauce)		
1 Tbsp white miso paste dissolved in two tbsp water		
1 Tbsp freshly squeezed ginger juice				
1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar						
2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds		

","
Preparation
To get the best taste from tofu I dry-fry it and then marinate it for a few hours, or overnight in the fridge.
To dry-fry simply press excess water out with paper-towel, slice the tofu and place in a dry-frying pan at a low heat and press with a spatula.  You will hear a hissing sound as the excess water is removed.  Turnover and do the other side. To marinade I use 1 Tbsp of each – freshly squeezed ginger juice, shoyu and mirin – you can add ¼ tsp turmeric, sweet paprika, garlic powder or whatever taste excites you.

Method
Press the tofu in paper towels to absorb any excess water.
Whisk the soya sauce, miso paste, ginger juice and vinegar in a cup and set aside.

Heat the toasted sesame oil in a wok over medium heat and add the garlic, onion and the mushrooms stir well and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the diced tofu and cook on a high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the kale stir and cover for 5 minutes or until it turns bright green adding a little water if necessary.
Add the broccoli cover for 3 or 4 minutes, if the pan seems dry add a splash more water.
Remove from the heat. Stir in the dressing.
Serve in bowls and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.

Quinoa Pumpkin Chili,"
Ingredients

1 packet of quinoa
2 cups of carrots (cut into ¼ inch pieces)
4 onions (diced)
8 cloves of garlic (chopped finely)
1 ½ tablespoons of chili powder
½ tablespoon of cumin
1 cup of canned 100% pure pumpkin
2 cans of your favourite beans (pinto, black, kidney), drained
1 ½ – 2 cups of vegetable broth
1 small can of tomato paste
1 can of corn
1-2 spring onions (chopped; optional garnish)
Vegan sour cream

","
Method

First, place a tablespoon of oil into a large pot and a sprinkle of salt; this will prevent sticking. Then, toss in the onion and garlic and cook on medium heat until the onions have softened (approximately 8-10 minutes). Whilst the onions and garlic are softening, cook the quinoa as per the instructions on the packet and set aside for later.
Once the onions have softened and the garlic is fragrant, cover them with the chili powder and cumin and stir in and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes until all of the moisture in the pot has evaporated (if you prefer adding more cumin/chili powder you can do so to your own taste). At this point stir in the tomato paste, broth and carrots, and simmer for 5-6 minutes to amalgamate the flavors.
Once the mixture has been brought to a simmer, stir in the pumpkin, then the beans and bring the chili to a boil. Once at a boil, reduce the heat and stir the beans until covered and cook them until cooked through (10-15 minutes). Once cooked, add the corn and quinoa to the chili last minute to heat through.
 Serve immediately with a small dollop of your favorite vegan sour cream and a few chopped pieces of spring onion.

1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder, optional

1 bottle (8oz.) dark beer (Negra Modelo 1 bottle = 1 1/2 cups) plus 1/2 cup additional water or 2 cups water

Optional garnish:

sliced scallions
Vegan Cashew Sour Cream


","

Instructions


Stovetop: In a large dutch oven or stock pot, heat your oil/water over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, spices and tempeh and cook for 5 minutes stirring frequently. Add beans, tomatoes, green chili and dark beer/water, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, partially cover and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Chili will thicken upon cooling.
Slow Cooker: Add the ingredients to the bowl of your slow cooker, ending with the liquids. Cook on LOW for 6 – 8 hours or HIGH  for 3 – 4 hours. Chili will thicken as it cools.
Serve with optional garnish. Also, pairs perfectly with Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins or Sweet Chia Cornbread!
Serves 4 – 6
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 5 – 6, kept in airtight container. To store longer, store in the freezer with freezer safe containers for 2 – 3 months.
NOTES:
Mix the beans up however you like using all of one type or your favorite combination. If you would rather use only 2 cans of beans, that’s great too! I like adding more ingredients as it makes the chili go further. If using your own cooked beans you’ll need about 4 1/2 cups.
Feel free to use 2 packages tempeh instead of just 1. At times I like the extra dose of protein the tempeh adds and will double the amount making for an extra hearty chili. It’s just so good!
For those who do not care for the taste of tempeh, I recommend making this a day ahead so the flavors really meld into the tempeh masking most of its natural flavor. Or try using the three grain tempeh as its flavor is not as strong.
If you find if you added too much heat from the chipotle, try adding a teaspoon or so of cocoa/cacao powder or organic sugar.
UPDATED: This recipe was updated in Sept. 2019 with new photos and helpful tips. The only changes made to the recipe was adding a can of sweet corn. Since so many who commented on the recipe added it, I thought I would do the same. It’s delicious, but optional!

Instructions


Prep: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat. See notes for microwave instructions.
Sweet Potato: Scrub the sweet potatoes to remove any dirt. Using a fork poke holes into the top of the sweet potato so it can release steam while cooking. Place on a lined rimmed baking sheet and bake in the oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool a few minutes.
Chili: If making a fresh batch, cook the chili while the sweet potatoes are baking. If using leftovers, reheat the chili 5 – 7 minutes or so before baked sweet potatoes are done.
Assemble: Slice the sweet potato lengthwise along the top where the holes were poked. Gently, and slightly, open the sweet potato and fill with your 3/4 – 1 cup of chili.
Serve: Top with optional garnish and enjoy this delicious hearty meal! Pairs great with Vegan Cornbread or Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins!
Serves 2 – 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in covered containers in the refrigerator for 4 – 5 days. Store the chili and sweet potatoes separately or assembled.
NOTES:
Microwave instructions: Place the sweet potatoes on a microwave-safe dish and microwave for 5 – 10 minutes. Add two minutes for each additional potato, rotating them halfway through. Sweet potatoes are done when a fork spears into them easily.

",Lasagne
Butternut Squash and Sage Lasagne,"
Ingredients

For the butternut ‘pasta’:
1 butternut squash
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp maple syrup
8 sage leaves (fresh)
Black pepper
For the tomato sauce:
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp cinnamon
6 cloves garlic
1 red chilli
1 red onion
250g chestnut mushrooms
4 medium tomatoes (you could also use a tin of chopped tomatoes; cooking time will be less)
2 tsp red pepper / tomato puree
125 ml red wine
1 tbsp vinegar (red wine or balsamic)
Black pepper
For the white sauce:
1 tsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp cumin
1 tbsp coconut flour
125 ml non-dairy milk
350g silken firm tofu
1 tbsp lemon juice
3 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
Himalayan pink salt, to taste
250g baby spinach
2 vegan sausages (such as Field Roast, Chipotle flavour) sliced into thin discs
Handful of grated vegan cheese

","
Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
To prepare the butternut, begin by peeling with a sharp knife. I find the easiest way to do this is to first slice off the ends, followed by cutting it in half across the middle. You can now slice the skin off from top to bottom on each half. Once peeled, cut each half lengthways through the middle and scoop the seeds and stringy bits from the bottom half. Now slice each segment thinly, so you have lots of half crescent ‘pasta’ sheets.
Lay the butternut slices on an oven tray and drizzle over the olive oil and maple syrup. Chop the sage leaves into 1cm wide ribbons and sprinkle these on with some black pepper. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes.
While the butternut slices are cooking, prepare the tomato sauce. Finely chop the red onion, garlic and chilli and chop the mushrooms into quarters. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a large pan and add the spices: cooking these first releases the flavours. Add the onion, garlic, chilli and mushrooms and cook for about 10 minutes (or when slightly browned and soft).
Chop the tomatoes into small chunks and add these to the pan with the pepper/tomato paste, red wine and vinegar. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until reduced. It should be thick, but still loose. Add the black pepper towards the end of cooking.
While the tomato sauce is reducing you can make the white sauce. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a saucepan and add the spices and garlic. Keep an eye on the garlic – you want it to brown lightly but not burn. Once the garlic has begun to colour stir in the flour – much like making a roux for a béchamel sauce. Stir for a minute and then add the milk to create a sauce, continuing to stir. Next, add the tofu and mash it into the sauce using the back of the spoon. You can now stir in the remaining ingredients and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Again, it should be thick but loose.
Finally, wilt the spinach by putting it in a pan on a low heat. Give it a stir and drain the water- this only takes about 5 minutes.
Now for the assembly! Layer the ingredients in a deep dish or tin. I put mine together in the following order: tomato sauce, white sauce, spinach and sausage slices, butternut squash. Repeat until you have used all the ingredients and finish with a sprinkling of cheese.
Cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the top is nice and crisp. Let it stand for 5 minutes before serving, so that the layers hold their shape.
Wonderful! Serve with steamed greens and a Miso dressing, which work really well as a contrasting tang to all of the earthy flavours of the lasagne.

Lentil Lasagne,"
Ingredients
1 large red onion
2 large cloves of garlic
200g (7oz) mushrooms
Splash of olive oil
200g (7oz) puy lentils (or brown lentils)
450ml (15fl oz) spring water
1 heaped teaspoon allspice
1 heaped teaspoon cinnamon
Pinch ground cardamom
500ml (17fl oz) passata (or tinned tomatoes)
1 heaped teaspoon coconut sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 large handful fresh parsley
150g (5oz) rice pasta
1 small apple
For the Cashew ‘cheeze’ sauce:
100g (3½ oz) cashews
1 large lemon
Pinch black pepper
½ teaspoon sea salt
1 heaped teaspoon dried parsley
Extra water (to thin if needed)
","
Preparation
You will need:
An oven proof dish approx 21 x 15cm (6cm deep) or 8½ x 6 inches (2½in deep).

The cashew sauce is made by first soaking the cashews for up to an hour to make them soft enough to blend.


Method

Place the cashews into a mug or jug along with the juiced lemon, salt, pepper and parsley.
Allow the cashews to soak in the lemon juice for up to an hour and then blend with a blender to create a thick creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick then add a dash of water to achieve your desired sauce-like consistency.
Roughly chop red onion and mushrooms.
Crush or finely chop garlic and saute in a medium sized pan with onion and mushrooms (with a splash of olive oil) for a couple of minutes to bring out their flavour.
Add the lentils and water to the pan and bring to the boil.
In the meantime add allspice, cinnamon, cardamon, sea salt, coconut sugar and passata to the pan, stirring to mix everything together.
Once the pan has come to the boil turn down to a low/medium heat, placing the lid on. Stir regularly over a period of about 45 minutes or until all water has absorbed and the mixture resembles a thick sauce. If you are busy and want to come back to this later, then simply cook for about 30 minutes, turn off and leave it to finish cooking with the lid on, in its own heat.
Whilst the lentil part is cooking in the pan, cook the pasta, drain it and put to the side.
Slice apple into thin slices and roughly chop parsley. When the lentil part has cooked, add the parsley to the pan and mix in.
Spoon about half of this lentil mixture into an oven proof dish and add a layer of your cooked rice pasta (this should be about ½ of your pasta). Make up another layer on top of the pasta with your apple slices.
Spoon the rest of your lentil mixture on top of your apple layer and then add another layer with the rest of the pasta.
Spoon/pour on your cashew sauce on top of the final layer of pasta. If the cashew sauce seems too thick, then add a little water to loosen it up.
Your layers might resemble something like this:
(base) lentil – pasta – apple – lentil – pasta – cashew sauce (topping)
But remember there is no right or wrong. If your creativity is inspired, then let it flow!
Place your whole dish in the oven at gas mark 6 (200˚C/400˚F) for approximately 40 minutes and then serve hot with veggies or salad.

1/4 cup vegan buffalo sauce (like Frank’s Red Hot)
1 tsp dried thyme
For the Creamy Cashew White Sauce:
1/2 cup soaked raw cashews
6 tablespoons soya flour (or plain flour or gf flour)
1 tsp mustard powder
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
1 clove of garlic
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
2 cups unsweetened non dairy milk (I prefer soya or almond)
For the lasagne:
4 tomatoes
1 x 500g box dried lasagne sheets
Sea salt and cracked black pepper

","
Preparation
Serves six

Method

Preheat the oven to 200’C.
Cut the unpeeled pumpkin or squash into wedges and de-seed, place on a baking tray and roast for 20-30 minutes or until the squash is soft and golden.
Leave to cool enough to handle and carefully peel away the skin and place the flesh into the jug of a blender.
Add the sage, salt, pepper and half the milk.
Blend, adding the remaining milk as necessary to get a smooth purée. Pour into a bowl, cover and set aside. Do not clean out the blender jug.
Add all of the tomato sauce ingredients into the jug and blend until well combined and almost smooth. Transfer to a saucepan and wash out the blender jug.
Blend together the white sauce ingredients until perfectly smooth, transfer to a saucepan.
Bring both the tomato and white sauce to a boil, whisking the white sauce all the time until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Assemble the lasagne, take a large baking dish approx 15 x 10 inches and place about a quarter of the tomato sauce on the base, topped with a quarter of the lasagne sheets.
Top with more tomato sauce, some pumpkin purée then more lasagne sheets, then white sauce and repeat until all is used up, ending with white sauce.
Place slices of tomato over the top, sprinkle with salt and pepper then transfer to the oven and bake for 30-45 minutes until the pasta is al dente and the top is golden and bubbling.
Leave to cool for about ten minutes before slicing and serving.

For the creamy bechamel:
70g vegan butter
70g plain flour
200ml Elmlea Plant Double (or your choice of dairy-free cream)
650ml plant-based milk
4 tbsp of nutritional yeast
","
Preparation
Preheat the oven to 200°C / 392°F. Top and tail the carrots then slice them into1/2cm thick rings. Add them to a large baking tray, sprinkle with small pinches of salt and pepper and drizzle with a light splash of olive oil. Toss through with your hands then roast for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, remove the stems from the red peppers and dice them. Then top and tail the courgettes and peel the red onions then slice both into 1/2cm rings. Finely chop the rosemary leaves.
Add the red peppers, courgettes, red onion and rosemary to the baking tray with the carrots along with small pinches of salt and pepper and a light drizzle of olive oil. Toss with a spoon to combine everything together. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes.
Drizzle a little olive oil in a medium saucepan on a medium heat. Peel and dice the garlic cloves then throw them into the saucepan and fry for 2 minutes. Next add the tinned tomatoes and small pinches of salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, add the vegan butter to a frying pan over a medium heat. Once melted, add the flour, stir to combine and fry for 2 minutes. Pour in the cream and whisk regularly so that the sauce becomes smooth. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking continuously so the sauce remains smooth. Season with pinches of salt and pepper, then add the nutritional yeast. Continue stirring until the sauce begins to thicken.
To build the lasagne, first add a few large spoonfuls of the tomato sauce to a large roasting dish and spread evenly. Then layer with 4 sheets of lasagne, followed by a few spoonfuls of bechamel. Next evenly spread 1/3 of the roasted vegetables on top. Repeat one more time starting again with a few spoonfuls of tomato sauce until you have 2 layers of lasagne sheets. Next later with a few spoonfuls of tomato sauce, 4lasagne sheets, and a few spoonfuls of bechamel. Next evenly spread the pesto over the bechamel and then layer with the remaining roasted vegetables. Finish with the last few spoonfuls of tomato sauce. Next sprinkle over the grated vegan cheese and finally spoon the remaining bechamel over the top. Spread the bechamel out evenly over the top of the lasagne.
Roast in the oven for 30-35 mins or until golden on top. Leave to sit for at least 10 mins before serving.

Chinese Red BBQ Strips,"
Ingredients

For the seitan strips:
– 125g (1 cup) wheat gluten
– 2tsp chinese five spice powder
– 1tsp smoked paprika
– 2tsp onion powder
– 2tsp garlic powder
– 180ml (3/4 cup) cold vegetable stock
– 3tbsp light soy sauce
– 3tbsp peanut butter
– 1tbsp sesame oil to grease the tin (or regular oil if you have no sesame)
For the sauce:
– 125ml (1/2 cup) hoisin sauce
– 125ml (1/2 cup) soy sauce
– 50g (1/4 cup) soft brown sugar
– 3 cloves of minced garlic
– 2tsp Chinese five spice powder
– tsp onion powder
– small amount of vegan red food colouring

","
Preparation
Start with preparing the seitan by heating the oven to 375f / 190c / Gas Mark 5.
You will also need:
– 8 inch x 8 inch greaseproof baking dish.

Method
Preparing the Seitan:
1) Combine the first 5 dry ingredients and set to one side.
2) To the cold vegetable stock, add the soy sauce and peanut butter. Whisk together well.
3) Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, add the liquid and bring together. You may need to use a spoon or spatula to combine initially but once it forms a dough the best thing to do is just get stuck in with your hands.
4) Kneed the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or so until it toughens up and holds its shape. Let it rest for 10 minutes then kneed again for a further 5-10 minutes.
5) Oil an 8inch x 8inch dish, shape the seitan dough to the dish and bake in the oven for 30 – 40 minutes.
Preparing the Sauce:
1) Whilst the seitan is cooking in the oven, you can move on to preparing the sauce. Very simply add all of the ingredients to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat for 10 – 15 minutes until it has reduced, the sugar has melted and thickened the sauce.
Marinating and Cooking the Seitan:
This recipe works best if you can prepare it the day before and leave time for the seitan to marinate in the sauce overnight. However, if you’re pushed for time then marinating for 4 hours or so should suffice.
1) Once the seitan has cooled, slice into strips and add to a fresh dish large enough to accommodate the marinade.
2) To marinate, take half of the prepared sauce, add 50ml of water to thin it out and cover the seitan strips. Cover with cling film and pop it in the fridge.
3)  To cook the strips, once they have marinated for as long as you have time to allow, add them to a heated frying pan along with the marinade and fry on medium-high for 10 minutes.
4) Turn the strips over regularly to ensure even cooking and add the remaining half of the sauce. Lower to heat to medium and continue cooking for a further 5 – 10 minutes to heat through the sauce. Be sure to continue turning the strips every few minutes for even cooking.
The strips are now ready to use as you wish, whether it be with noodles, fried rice or in a veggie stir fry.
",BBQ
BBQ Tofu Wings and Ranch,"
Ingredients

For the tofu:
1 block (250-300g) firm tofu
2 tbsp gram flour + 3 tbsp water
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried onion granules
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp cayenne pepper
For the BBQ sauce:
1 tin tomatoes (400g), puréed
2 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp good soy sauce
Juice of ½ an orange
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried chilli flakes (or cayenne pepper)
Black pepper
For the ranch:
2 tbsp tahini
4 tbsp water
Handful of fresh dill leaves (about 10g)
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp lemon juice
½ tsp dijon mustard
½ tsp vinegar (apple cider, red wine)
1 tsp dried marjoram or oregano
Pinch cayenne pepper

","
Preparation
THE DAY BEFORE: cut the block of tofu into 5 slices, each about 1 cm thick, then cut each slice in half again so you have 10 pieces. Place between sheets of kitchen paper on a plate and freeze. Remove from the freezer a couple of hours before you want to start cooking, in order to defrost.

Method

Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Once the tofu has defrosted, press between sheets of kitchen paper until most of the water has gone (you can do this using a heavy book). You don’t want the tofu to be so dry that it crumbles, but just to remove most of the water.
Combine the ingredients for the tofu coating ‘batter’ in a bowl.
Dip each tofu wing into the batter to fully coat and place on a non-stick baking tray, greased with a little oil if needed.
Place on the top shelf of the oven and cook for 30 minutes, turning once half way through.
Next, put the BBQ sauce on to simmer. Combine all the ingredients and cook on a medium heat on the hob, covering with a lid once it starts to bubble and spit. You want a thick sauce, so simmer for 20-30 minutes.
While the wings and BBQ sauce are cooking, make the ranch. Put all the ingredients into a food processor and blitz until smooth.
Once the wings have been cooking for 30 minutes, remove from the oven. Carefully place each one in the BBQ sauce, coat using a spoon, then place back onto the baking tray.
Cook for a further 10 minutes, arrange on a plate with the ranch and serve!

NOTES: Freezing the tofu isn’t essential, but it leads to a chewier texture. If you’re not freezing it, drain and press for a little longer, ensuring as much water is squeezed out as possible.

Measure out ketchup, honey, vinegar and brown sugar into a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring until smooth. Stir the liquid smoke and the rest of the ingredients into the ketchup mixture, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes.
While the sauce is simmering, chop your veggies chunkily. Toss in a little oil to coat.
Carefully cut each Like Breaded Chicken fillet into 5-6 pieces with a sharp knife and place in a large bowl/tub.
When the Vegan Honey BBQ Sauce is ready, drizzle it over the Like Breaded Chicken pieces and stir gently to ensure they’re evenly coated.
Thread veggies and the sauce coated Like Breaded Chicken pieced onto skewers. (If using wooden skewers, wet them first to avoid them burning when grilling.)
Cook skewers on the barbecue for around 20 mins until piping hot, turning regularly, and veggies are nicely charred round the edges.
If the weather is not right for a barbecue, you can cook the dish in an oven proof tray in the middle of the oven, pre-heated to 200°c.
Serve the Like Breaded Chicken skewers with a fresh summer salad and boiled new potatoes, tossed in plant based butter and topped with chopped fresh chives.

Club Mexicana’s BBQ Pulled Jackfruit,"
Ingredients

2 jalapeños, finely chopped
2 tbsp vegetable oil
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tbsp chilli powder
2 tsp cumin
0.5 tsp cayenne
500ml ketchup
125ml (1/2 cup) lime juice (more if you like it tangy)
1 cup dark brown sugar
4 tins (cans) of jackfruit in brine
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp dijon mustard

","
Method

Fry the garlic & jalapeños in oil for a minute. Add all the spices, stir and cook until fragrant (a minute or so). Add ketchup, lime and brown sugar. Stir until all the sugar has melted. Partially cover and keep cooking on a low heat until sauce has thickened to the consistency of ketchup.


Drain and thoroughly rinse the tinned jackfruit. Use your hands to tear the strands of jackfruit from the harder core. The fruit will come apart very easily. Put the pulled jackfruit into a bowl and put the cores into another bowl. Once everything has been pulled apart use a knife to finely chop the harder cores. It doesn’t matter if these are still a bit chunky once chopped as it adds more texture to the dish.


Heat oil in pan and add the pulled jackfruit. Cook until it gets a bit grey and loses some moisture. Add the dijon mustard and stir in. Add a little water if it starts to stick to the pan.


Add about half the BBQ sauce (more if you want a very sticky dish) and stir in to coat. Cook until it’s almost starting to get a little crispy and sticking to the pan a little.


Spoon on top of warm corn tacos and top with cos lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, a squeeze of fresh lime and a sprinkle of coriander.
