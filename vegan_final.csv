Pizza,Chilli Vegetable Pizza,"
Ingredients

125g ’00’ flour
125g strong wholemeal flour
1/2 tsp dried active yeast*
4g dried chipotle mora chilli
very finely diced
5g Himalayan pink salt (or table salt)
150ml warm water
12 cherry tomatoes
1/2 red onion
1 large clove garlic
7g ancho poblano chilli
soaked with seeds
1/2 cup water
2 tblsps balsamic vinegar

","
Preparation
Makes 2 individual 8″ pizzas
Equipment

Food processor with dough blade
Pizza stone or tray
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Frying pan


Method
Add all of the flours, yeast*, salt and chipotle mora to the food processor with the dough blade and turn on.
*I only had dried active yeast to hand, so added it to the ingredients above, (ignoring the actual instructions on the container) with full success!
Pour the water in a steady trickle until you’ve used it all and the dough becomes a ball.
Take the dough out of the processor, lightly flour your surface and set the timer for 10 mins. Knead and stretch the dough the whole time – if your arms start to ache, just image the amazing workout you’re giving them without stepping inside a gym!
Once the timer goes off, shape into a ball, put into a deep bowl that’s had a light sprinkling of flour on the bottom, cover with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Once rested, take it out of the bowl and knead again for 10 seconds – this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten.
Divide into 2 equally sized, smooth balls of dough and put into a deep baking dish, lightly sprinkled with flour. Make sure the dish is big enough for them to spread up to twice their size because as the gluten relaxes, they will spread to some degree.
* Top Tip *
I’ve made this base numerous times and sometimes the dough spreads a lot, other times it hardly spreads at all. Don’t worry, it’s always tasted great either way!
Leave to rest at room temperature overnight, or if you’re in a massive hurry, at least eight hours! I don’t leave mine in a very warm place like the airing cupboard as I found it can dry out and form a ‘skin’ on the outside.
* Top Tip *
The resting time for the dough is ideally 24 hours, but 48 hours is maximum.
Put the normal blade back into your food processor and add in the tomatoes, onion, garlic and ancho poblano, pulse for 10-20 seconds to break them up into small chunks, and pour into your frying pan.
* Top Tip *
You can choose how chunky or smooth to have the sauce when pulsing in the processor. Personally I prefer it chunky as it almost becomes one of the delicious pizza toppings.
Add the water, balsamic and simmer on a medium heat for 12-15 mins to let the flavours intensify, while stirring occasionally. It’s ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist; don’t let it dry out and stick to the pan.
* Top Tip *
The sauce flavours will develop the longer you leave it, so why not make it a couple of days in advance and keep in the fridge? It does however, also tastes great if you make it on the day.
Turn the oven on to the highest setting to heat up your pizza stone if you have one, otherwise 220c if you’re using a pizza tray.
* Top Tip *
For pizza stones, it’s always the hotter the better, so I usually pre-heat mine for an hour.
Lightly flour your surface, roll out the dough, add sauce and your favourite tasty toppings. Put into the oven for approx. 8 mins on the pizza stone. I haven’t cooked them on a pizza tray before, but as it won’t have the intense heat of the stone, I’d suggest 10-12 mins (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t overcook on top).
* Serving Suggestion *
These chilli pizzas are a spicy alternative to your usual takeaway version – the base has a delicious hot and smokey bite to it, yet this is balanced perfectly by the sweet flavours of the tomato sauce. Throw a pizza party and impress your friends with your cooking skills, or snuggle up on the sofa with your loved one and enjoy all to yourselves!
I honestly don’t miss cheese on pizza once I throw on a mix of veggies, Dee’s vegan sausage and lots of hot, sweet roquito peppers – what’s on your list of ultimate pizza toppings?

Burger,Curried Bean Burgers in Portabello Buns,"
Ingredients
Burgers and ‘buns’:

2 cartons (400g drained) cannellini beans
2 medium carrots
1 large parsnip
2 portobello mushrooms per person (or a bun of your choice)
1/3 ripe avocado per person
2 tbsp chickpea flour (can substitute for another kind of flour)
4 tbsp tomato puree
2 tbsp water
1 1/2 tbsp curry powder
1 tsp paprika powder
1 tsp chilli powder
Grind of pepper

Sweet potato fries:

1 small- medium sweet potato per person
glug of olive oil
salt & pepper

","
Method

Peel and grate the carrots and parsnip and put them on a baking tray to roast for about 5 minutes. Rinse and drain the beans, then transfer them to a bowl and mash with a fork. Add in the spices and 2 table spoons tomato puree then mash again. Next mix in the carrot, parsnip and chickpea flour. You should have a stiff dough that sticks together.
Take a handful of the mixture and shape it into a burger patty. Place on a floured baking tray. Do this until you have 6-8 burgers. Put the burgers into the oven to cook for 30 minutes, turning once.
To make the sweet potato fries peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into chip shapes. Make sure not to make them too fat otherwise they will take too long to cook! Place all of the fries on a baking tray with room between them and coat with a glug of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and put in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.
To make the ‘buns’ remove the mushroom stork and peel off the skin. Place the mushrooms on a baking tray and put it in the oven once the burgers have been cooking for 20 minutes. Turn the burgers over if you haven’t done so already. After 5 minutes turn over the mushrooms.
Mix the remaining 2 table spoons of tomato puree with two table spoons of water to make a quick tomato sauce. Then mash the avocado.
Remove the mushrooms and burgers from the oven. The mushrooms should have softened but still be able to hold the weight of the burgers. Make the burger by layering a mushroom with tomato sauce, a curried bean burger, avocado, a second burger and a mushroom.
The fries should be done by now so remove them from the oven and serve with the burgers.

Sausage,Tempeh Sausage and Heirloom Tomatoes over Black Pepper Cheezy Polenta,"
Ingredients

Tempeh Sausage:
1 8oz package 3 grain tempeh
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 ½ teaspoons fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black peppercorns
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
¼ teaspoon celery seed
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
Dashes liquid smoke
1 clove garlic-minced
Black Pepper Cheezy Polenta:
4 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup corn meal
2 pinches crushed black peppercorns
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
Other Ingredients:
1/4 cup white wine
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 large red onion, diced small
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (we used heirloom cherry tomatoes, but you don’t have to)
1 red bell pepper, chopped into bite sized pieces
1 cup raw baby spinach leaves
5 large fresh basil leaves, cut small

","
Method

In a large bowl, toss all the ingredients for the tempeh sausage. Cover and let marinate while you make your polenta.
In a Dutch oven or another large pot, bring 4 cups of water, olive oil and salt to a boil. Gradually add your corn meal to the boiling water using a whisk to blend it in. Try to break up any clumps you see start to form. Once all your corn meal is added, whisk in your pepper and nutritional yeast. Then move to stirring your polenta with a wooden spoon, be sure to scrap the sides and bottom of the pot while you stir. You’re going to be stirring pretty much continually while your polenta thickens for about 40-45 minutes. Polenta is a needy dish.
Once your polenta is soft but firm – you’ll know what I mean, put a lid on top . Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in your deepest skillet over a medium heat. Once your oil is hot, toss in your tempeh sausage mix, white wine, liquid amino acids and onions, and cook while mixing with a spatula until your tempeh has slightly crispy edges. Then toss your tomatoes and bell peppers in and let them cook for about 5 minutes, flipping them every once in a while to make sure they’re cooking evenly. Once your peppers are tender, mix in your spinach and basil leaves. Once they’re wilted, you’re done!
Serve your tempeh sausage & heirloom tomatoes over your polenta – being sure to get some of the thin “sauce” on the bottom of the skillet.

Ingredients
Mushroom and Chestnut Wellington:

200g Chestnut mushrooms
100g Shiitake mushrooms
300g Chestnuts, roasted and peeled
125g Cooked black-eyed beans
1 Red onion
2 Cloves garlic
1 tsp Dried sage
1 tbsp Mushroom ketchup (optional)
1 tbsp Olive oil
Salt and Pepper

Shortcrust Spelt Pastry:

175g Spelt flour
75g Vegan margarine
3-4 tbsp water
2 tbsp non-dairy milk for brushing

","
Method

Begin by cooking your chestnuts. Whilst your chestnuts are roasting, finely chop the onion and gently fry in a frying pan until translucent and just starting to caramelise.


Mince the garlic and slice the mushrooms and stir into the onion. Sweat on a medium heat until most of the water has been released from the mushrooms and they are just starting to brown. Then set the pan aside to cool.


In a food processor, blend the beans and chestnuts until they start to resemble breadcrumbs. If you like a little extra texture blend the chestnuts separately and leave them a little coarser.


Place the bean and chestnut mixer into a large mixing bowl.


Blend the mushrooms in the food processor and add to the mixing bowl along with the sage, and mushroom ketchup if using.


Mix together well and season to taste and set aside whilst you make the pastry.


Measure out the flour and marg into a large mixing bowl and chop into the marg with a knife until cut into fairly small chunks. Then rub the mixture together with your fingertips until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.


Add the water a bit at a time until the mixture comes together in your hands to form a ball.


Place the pastry covered in the fridge for 20 mins before rolling it out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle.


Mould the mushroom mixture into a loaf shape in the centre of your pastry length ways.


Brush the pastry edges with milk and carefully roll the whole thing, leaving the seam underneath.


Pinch the ends together and brush the whole thing with milk, make a few small cuts in the pastry for steam to escape then place onto a greased baking tray.


Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180C for 35-40 mins until golden brown.

1. Rinse and drain the sushi rice in a sieve. Place the rice in a small saucepan with 220ml of water, bring up to a boil, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes until all the water has been absorbed.
2. Drain and wrap the tofu in kitchen paper then place between two plates with something heavy on top like a couple of tins. Leave to press for 20 minutes. This process allows the tofu to take on more flavour.
3. Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celsius.
4. Prepare the peanut sauce. Mix the peanut butter with 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of mirin, 1 tsp of sesame oil and 1 tbsp of water. Peel and finely chop or grate the garlic, then add to the sauce. Your sauce should be the consistency of single cream. If necessary add a splash more of water to loosen.
5. Prepare the filling. Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and scoop the flesh away from the skin, keeping the shape intact. Cut the avocado into strips lengthways. Peel and grate the carrot. Divide both into 4 equal portions. Cut the tofu into 8 slices and coat with 1 tsp of soy sauce. Place the coated tofu on a tray and bake in the oven for 8 minutes.
6. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a high heat for 1 minute or until golden, then tip onto a small plate.
7. Cool the rice. When the rice is cooked, take it off the heat and mix in 1.5 tbsp of rice wine vinegar, ½ a tsp of salt, ½ a tsp of sugar and most of the toasted sesame seeds, saving a sprinkle for garnishing. Spread the rice onto a plate and leave to cool, then divide into 4 equal portions.
8. After 8 minutes, take the tofu out of the oven and coat with half of the peanut sauce. Bake for another 10 minutes then remove from the oven and slice each strip in half lengthways.
9. Start rolling! Place a small bowl of water nearby. Lay 2 layers of clingfilm larger than the nori sheet over your clean chopping board. Place the nori on top of the clingfilm in portrait orientation. Using your hands, take one portion of rice and spread it evenly onto the half of the nori sheet closest to you, leaving a 1cm gap at the edge of the sheet. Wet your fingertips to stop the rice sticking to your hands.
10. Place your strips of tofu with a portion of avocado and carrots horizontally in the centre of the rice. Drizzle a little of the peanut sauce over the filling, then start rolling the sushi by placing your thumbs underneath the clingfilm and lifting the edge that is closest to you up and over the filling in the centre. Curve the rest of your fingers over the clingfilm and gently press against the length of the roll, squeezing the rice and filling together inside. Continue to roll the sushi away from you until you’ve rolled past the furthest edge of the nori sheet. You may need to use a little water to seal the edge. Repeat until you get 4 sushi rolls.
11. Use a sharp knife to cut each roll in half, then each half into 3 equal pieces. Rinse under the tap between slices to help get a clean cut. Garnish the sushi rolls with a sprinkling of the reserved sesame seeds and serve with the remaining soy sauce for dipping.
Top Tip: if you have a bamboo sushi mat, use it instead of this clingfilm method.

400g can of cooked chickpeas, drained
300g sweet potatoes
1/2-3/4 tsp dried chillies (depending on personal taste)
2 tbsp Pulsin soya protein powder

Burger,Spicy Bean Burgers with Avocado Salsa,"
Ingredients

1 large red onion 
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves of garlic
2 medium courgettes
2 medium carrots 
1 x 400g tin of kidney beans 
100g cooked rice
1 tbsp harissa paste
2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter, or use sunflower seed butter if making nut free
A small bunch of coriander
50g sesame seeds
For the avocado salsa:
½ yellow pepper
2 tomatoes
1 large ripe avocado
2 tomatoes
½ a small red onion
1 red chilli
Juice of 2 limes
A small bunch of coriander

","
Preparation
I like to use the outer leaves of an iceberg lettuce to wrap round the burgers, acting as a crisp bun.  That way you can add the salsa and perhaps a little hummus to make a real feast of it. It’s really important that you grate the carrot and courgette by hand as using a food processor can make them very soggy.
Makes 10 burgers       

Method
Place the tomatoes in a bowl and pour over boiling water, leave for 1 minute, drain the water off and gently remove the skin by peeling it off with a small sharp knife. Cut the tomatoes in half and using a teaspoon, scoop out the seeds and discard. Set the remaining tomato flesh aside.
Finely dice the onion, deseed the chilli and chop very finely.  Slice the avocado in half, remove the stone and then using a spoon scoop out the flesh in one half and then finely chop.  Slice the tomato flesh and yellow pepper into very small juice and then combine all of the ingredients into a bowl.  Pour over the lime juice, finely chop the coriander and stir through.  Season to taste, cover and leave to stand in the fridge until ready to use.
Finely chop the onion and crush the garlic.  Trim the ends from the courgette and carrots and then coarsely grate using a hand held grater.  Finely chop the coriander and set aside.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large frying pan and add the onion, fry gently for around 5 minutes or until softened and slightly coloured at the edges.  Add the garlic, courgettes and carrots to the pan, turn up the heat to medium – high and fry for a further 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the carrots and courgettes have softened and cooked through.
Add the peanut butter and harissa to the pan, season well and continue to cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly, until blended with the vegetables.  Take off the heat and leave to stand for five minutes or until cool enough to handle.  Meanwhile, drain and rinse the kidney beans and place them in a food processor.  Blitz until you have a smooth paste and then transfer to a large mixing bowl.  Alternatively, you can place the kidney beans into the mixing bowl and mash by hand, using a fork, until you have a thick paste.
Add the cooked rice, coriander and vegetable mixture to the beans and beat together until combined and pulled into a large ball.  Take a handful of the mixture – about 3 tablespoons worth – and shape into a patty approximately 2 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.  Scatter the sesame seeds over a flat plate, season and mix together before lightly rolling the burgers in them so that they are evenly coated.  Cover the burgers in clingfilm and refrigerate for 1 hour before cooking.
When ready to cook, heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan and cook for about 10 minutes, turning over once or twice, until golden brown and cooked through.

Rissoles,Seitan Rissoles / Seitanfrikadellen,"
Ingredients

In a big bowl mix well:
1 ¼ cup water
1/3 cup neutral oil (I use sunflower)
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce (or Maggi Sauce if you have)
1 teaspoon garlic granules
2 teaspoons mild mustard
1 teaspoon yeast extract (I’d use less Marmite or Vegemite, less than ½ teaspoon)
2 teaspoons hot paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
1-2 finely chopped onions
In a smaller bowl mix:
1 1/3 cups gluten flour
4 tablespoons bread crumbs

","
Preparation
Makes about nine rissoles.

Method
Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir well with a spoon. Knead a little with your hand until everything is well mixed, but don’t knead too long, otherwise you’ll squish the onions out of the dough. Cover the bowl with a warm, moist towel and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
Heat more neutral oil in a non-stick frying pan to medium heat. Form 9-10 meatballs and place them in the pan. They should not be crowded, I fry them in two batches.
It’s important not to fry them like you’re frying meat: they need to fry slowly on low to medium temperature (I use grade 3 of 6) for about 30 minutes. Flip them repeatedly after about 8 minutes to let them brown evenly. They stay soft for a long time and don’t start to brown till the end. After about 30 minutes they should be done, you can take them out when they have the desired colour.
Like most seitan ‘meats’ they’re best after cooling completely. Fresh out of the pan the crust is a little hard, it will soften after cooling while the inside gets firmer. They’re perfect after a night in the fridge. You can reheat them in a pan or in hot gravy. I serve them the traditional way, with mashed potatoes, roasted onions in a puddle of frying oil and lots of mustard.
Guten Appetit!

Quesadillas,Sweet Potato Quesadillas,"
Ingredients
Olive oil
1 sweet potato, peeled and grated
1 tablespoon maple syrup
Sea salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
1 teaspoon chipotle paste
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 × 400g tin of white beans, drained
1 avocado
½ a lime
A few sprigs of fresh mint or coriander, leaves picked and chopped
4 corn tortillas
","
Preparation
Most places have started to stock chipotle paste these days, which has made its sweet smokiness easier to come by. If you can’t get your hands on chipotle, ½ a teaspoon of hot smoked paprika will do.

Method

Heat a touch of olive oil in a pan, add the sweet potato and the maple syrup and season with salt and pepper.
Add the chipotle paste and the chopped chilli and cook for a few minutes, until the potato has softened and lost its rawness.
Transfer to a bowl and add the beans, then use a potato masher to mash the whole lot up a little – you will still have some flecks of unmashed sweet potato. Season if needed.
Mash the avocado with a little lime juice and stir in the herbs. I use the potato masher again here.
Now heat a frying pan big enough for your tortillas. Lay a tortilla fat in the pan, spoon a quarter of the mixture on to one half of it, then fold over the other half.
Dry fry on one side until it’s blistered and golden brown, then flip over and do the same on the other side. Keep the quesadilla warm while you do this with the rest of the tortillas.
Serve straight from the pan with the mashed avocado.

As part of a bigger meal:
Serve with a couple of handfuls of lemon-dressed salad leaves.
Serve with a crunchy salad of radishes, leaves, shaved fennel and coriander, and a quick tomato salsa.

Burger,Curried Chickpea Burgers,"
Ingredients

175g cooked quinoa
1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 carrots
1 white onion
1 tbsp curry paste of your choice, just ensure it is gluten and dairy free
3 tbsp gram flour
3 tbsp olive oil

","
Preparation

Makes 8 burgers

They freeze well and you don’t need to worry about defrosting them, you can simply fry them gently from frozen until cooked through, making them handy little things. 

Method
Begin by peeling the onion and carrots and then finely grating, either by hand or using a food processor. Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan and then gently fry the onion and carrots until softened – approximately 10 minutes.
Place the chickpeas and cooked quinoa into a large mixing bowl and crush together with a fork until you have a coarse, lightly-bound paste.  Add the softened onion, carrot and curry paste, season with a little sea salt and black pepper and mash together with a fork until bound together.
Using your hands, form the mixture into 8 burger patties and then coat each burger in gram flour, using as much or as little flour as you need to generously coat the burgers.
Heat the remaining oil in the large frying pan over a medium flame, add the burgers to the pan and fry the burgers on both sides until golden, slightly crisp and heated through.
While the cakes are frying dice the tomatoes, avocado and coriander.  Mix together in a small bowl with the lemon juice and season to taste.  Serve the burgers with a little pile of tomato salad on top and whatever accompaniments you like – roasted sweet potato wedges and a big green salad go very well.

Tagine,Vegetable Tagine with Summer Couscous,"
Ingredients

Vegetable Tagine:
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves crushed garlic
3 large onions, thinly sliced, half moons
1 tsp ground cinnamon
2 large carrots, sliced in half
½ butternut squash, cut into bite size chunks
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into bite size chunks
1 courgette, sliced in half
Summer Couscous:
3 cups couscous
4 ½ cups filtered water
1 tsp sea salt
1 Tbsp olive oil (optional)
Canned organic chickpeas
Finely chopped spring onions
Fresh mint
Lemon infused olive oil
Sea salt

","
Method
Tagine:

Heat the olive oil in a heavy based pan.
Add the garlic, onion and cinnamon. Heat on low for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring to coat the onion and garlic with the cinnamon.
Cook until fragrant and crisp. Set aside.
In a tagine or heavy based pot, place the carrots, squash, sweet potatoes and courgette in sections.
Add about an inch of water, cover and place on a very low heat for approximately 25-30 minutes or until vegetables are soft.
Add a little more water if the tagine seems too dry. Serve on a bed of couscous and top with the onions and garlic.

Summer Couscous:

Add the salt and oil to boiling water.
Spread couscous evenly in the bottom of a large casserole so that it is in as thin a layer as possible.
Add the water and cover tightly with a lid or clingfilm.
Wait until all the water is absorbed (about 15 minutes), then fluff with a fork – add a little olive oil here if you wish.

For a delicious and simple couscous salad recipe, make the couscous as described above. Let it cool, and then toss it with canned organic chickpeas, finely chopped spring onions, fresh mint, lemon infused olive oil, and sea salt. Other nice additions are raisins, pine nuts, black and green olives, and flat leaf parsley.

Chickpeas, cannellini beans or borlotti beans add texture and extra protein for vegetarians.
Add lemon juice, loads of flat-leaf parsley, mint, coriander, olive oil and pepper for a salad.
Add roasted vegetables with cooked brown lentils for a great main course for a buffet or a packed lunch.

Tortillas,Refried Beans with Corn Tortillas,"
Ingredients

Sesame Oil 
2 cloves crushed garlic
1 onion finely sliced
½ cup coriander/cilantro finely chopped
1 jar organic mixed beans
1 to 2 tbsp tamari or shoyu sauce (to taste)
Mixed salad greens
Salsa or relish

","
Method
A few easy steps to refried beans:

Heat about 4 tbsp of sesame oil in a heavy frying pan or a wok, over medium heat.
Add the garlic and sliced onion and sauté until softened and beginning to brown, about five minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the coriander.
Add the cooked beans, and using a big spoon, or potato masher start mashing the beans in the oil.
The unique taste of refried beans occurs as a result of slowly frying the starches inside the beans in the oil, so you want to add the beans a little bit at a time if you are using more than one jar. This way of cooking the beans makes sure they all get fried and take on the flavours of the vegetables and coriander.
Once all the beans have been mashed add the shoyu or tamari and a little water, until you get the texture that you want. Keep it a bit looser than you eventually want, as they will continue to firm up as they cool off the heat.
These will also freeze well, so it’s a good idea to make more than you need. The recipe above can be easily doubled or more.

Plate up:

Warm the corn tortillas in a dry frying pan for a few minutes either side.
Remove to a plate.
Spread with some vegan mayonnaise, fill with salad and top with the beans and some relish or salsa if desired.
If you prefer a hot spicy taste adjust the ingredients accordingly.

Gnocchi,Oven-baked Squash Gnocchi with Sun-dried Tomato & Fennel and Spinach Pistou,"
Ingredients

1 large squash, about 1.5kg (the more starchy varieties of summer squash are best, such as butternut) peeled and cut into rough chunks olive oil, for roasting 
a little sea salt
1 large fennel bulb, thinly sliced lengthways 
240g firm tofu, well drained
300g unbleached white flour, sifted 
1 teaspoon sea salt 
½ teaspoon white pepper 
1½ teaspoons dried sage 
2 big handfuls of sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped 
1x spinach pistou
For the topping:
2 tablespoons roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped

","
Preparation
Serves 4 – 6.
First make the spinach pistou (even better if you can make it the day before). Pistou is a Provencal version of Pesto – much lighter, without the cheese and pine nuts.
Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6.

Method

Place the squash on an oiled baking tray. Rub a little oil and salt over it and bake for 30 minutes, turning the pieces gently over once. You’re not looking for loads of colour here, just lovely soft, golden squash.


Toss the fennel in olive oil, place on a separate baking tray and scatter with a pinch of sea salt. Bake for 30 minutes, turning once, until it’s nicely golden and sweet. When the squash is ready, put it into a processor with the tofu and blend until smooth. Now, place in a large bowl and stir in the flour, salt, pepper and sage until a soft dough forms. Leave to cool down and firm up – it will be a lot easier to handle.


Using two teaspoons, make gnocchi shapes (lovely little flat oval dumplings) with the mixture and place on an oiled baking sheet, leaving about 5cm of space for each gnocchi to grow. Brush the gnocchi with a little more oil and bake for 20–25 minutes, until crisp and slightly golden.


Serve the gnocchi warm, on nice big plates, drizzled liberally with the pistou. Scatter the crispy fennel and sun-dried tomatoes on top with a little more pistou, and finish with some chopped roasted hazelnuts.

Pizza,Homemade Vegan Pizza/Nacho Cheese,"
Ingredients

1 x large potato
1 x large carrot
(3 tablespoons of the potato/carrot water)
1/2 cup of oil (I use olive)
1/2 cup of nutritional yeast
Juice of half a lemon
Teaspoon of garlic granules
Dash of celery salt
Cracked pepper

","
Preparation
This is the same cheese recipe featured in my Cheese on Toast, just in another guise. 

Method
There are lots of recipes for potato cheese out there, but this is the one I have adapted from various different ones*.

Peel one large potato and one large carrot
Chop into small chunks (carrot smaller than the potato as it is harder)
Boil until soft
Put 3 tablespoons of the potato water into a food processor
Drain potatoes and carrots and pour into the processor
Add: 1/2 cup of oil (I use olive), 1/2 cup of nutritional yeast, juice of half a lemon, teaspoon of garlic granules, dash of celery salt, cracked pepper
Blend!
You can eat this cheese straight away with tortilla chips, pour over nachos (maybe chuck it in the oven for a bit to make sure the cheese is really warm) or use as your cheese topping on pizza… Spread as liberally as you like! Sometimes you feel like more or less cheese, depending on your mood and/or the pizza toppings. The photos above are both with the same cheese… Just lots more on one that the other.
When cooked to your liking, remove and eat!

*According to everything I’ve read, this cheese can last up to 7 days in the fridge. Mine has never hung around that long, so I would say use within a couple of days to be on the safe side.

Chicken Nuggets,Vegan Chicken Nuggets,"
Ingredients

Vegan chicken nuggets ingredients:
400g firm tofu
80g chickpea flour
5 tbsp nutritional yeast
3 tbsp American mustard
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
Cracked black pepper
Other ingredients:
Breadcrumbs (e.g. gluten-free ones)
On the side:
Potato salad
Ketchup

","
Method
Start squeezing all the water out of 400g of firm tofu. This takes about 20 minutes. The more you squeeze the water out of tofu the more it will absorb flavours.
Then roughly crumble the tofu into a food processor and all other ingredients. Blend well until you get a smooth mixture. You may need to add a TINY bit of water as well. And don’t taste the mixture, the uncooked chickpea flour tastes bitter and needs to be cooked first before it is consumed.
Then spoon out the mixture with a tablespoon. And press into a bowl with breadcrumbs. Bread evenly on all sides and then fry in hot oil until golden brown (make sure the oil is hot). Place on a kitchen towel as it will absorb some of the excess oil.
Serve on its own with ketchup or other dips or with a delicious Austrian potato salad. Enjoy!

Add the swede, squash, mushrooms and more seasoning to the casserole, and sweat for approximately 10 minutes… until the mushrooms are soft
Stir in the fresh thyme and chestnuts, and almost cover the ingredients with boiling water (if unsure best to add less, otherwise the stew will be too thin), add a little more seasoning
Once it comes to the boil reduce the heat, cover with a lid and gently simmer for 40-60 minutes
Season to taste and serve with fresh tarragon
Optional: upgrade with Pulsin’ Pea Protein!

Bring the mixture to the boil, then add the tofu. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2–3 minutes, until the tofu is heated through. Stir in the sweet basil, lime leaves and sliced chilli.
Remove the pan from the heat. Serve the curry immediately, with a bowl of rice, garnished with extra basil leaves.

Steak,Ginger chilli Tofu Steaks,"
Ingredients

1 pack of tofu (396g)
1 red chilli. Deseeded and finely chopped
3 tbsp tamari or dark soya sauce
Juice from 1 large orange
1 tsp coconut oil
3 balls of stem ginger, sliced finely into strips
1/2 tsp coconut sugar
Zest from 1 large orange
Black pepper
Optional: ½ tbsp Pulsin protein powder to thicken the sauce

","
Method
 

Drain the water from the tofu and blot. Slice into chunky steaks approximately 1.5cm thick.


In a container large enough to accommodate the tofu steaks, mix together the marinade ingredients: ginger, chilli, coconut sugar, tamari or soya sauce, orange zest, orange juice and black pepper. If you are using protein powder, add this to the sauce later.


Immerse the tofu steaks. Cover and pop in the fridge for at least an hour to allow the flavours of the marinade to soak in.


Melt coconut oil in a shallow pan. Drain the steaks from the sauce and on a low-heat pan-fry for about 8-10 mins, turning over half-way through with a fish-slice. Alternatively, you can grill the steaks (allow 9-10 mins).


While the steaks are cooking, mix in the protein powder to the sauce (if using) and heat gently in a saucepan. Pour over the steaks. Serve. Enjoy!

Meatballs,Mighty Meatballs,"
Ingredients
For the ‘meatballs’
1 x 400g tinned red kidney beans (drained and rinsed)
1/2 red onion roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves
35g oats
30g walnuts
4 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
Small handful of fresh basil
For the sauce
1/2 red onion sliced
1 carrot diced
120ml vegan red wine
120ml vegetable stock
300g Tideford Organics Tomato & Basil Sauce (or similar)
Oil for frying
","
Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper unless you’re using a non stick tray.
Add the meatball ingredients to a food processor and process the ingredients together until the mixture reaches a rough consistency, ensuring some larger pieces remain. It’s really important you avoid processing the ingredients for too long, otherwise the meatballs will turn into a mush!
Take roughly a tbsp of the mixture in your hand and roll it into a ball, then place it on the baking tray. Repeat until all the mixture has been used up and you’re left with 12 balls.
Transfer the baking tray to the oven and bake the balls for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by first adding a little oil to a frying pan on a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the red onion and fry for 3 minutes. Then add the carrot and fry for a further 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Next, add the wine to the pan and simmer on a low heat for 5 minutes.
Then add the vegetable stock, sauce, and finally add the meatballs to the pan. Simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the sauce has started to thicken.
Remove the pan from the hob and serve. We recommend serving with mashed potato and a sprinkle of basil. Enjoy!

•	½ Tb. Ground Flaxseed
•	1 ½ Tb. Water
•	1 1/3 cup Cooked Sweet Potato
•	1 cup Canned Garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
•	2 Tb. Dry Quick Oats
•	2 T. + 1/3 c. (divided) Bread Crumbs – regular, panko, whole wheat or gluten-free all work!
•	1-2 T. Finely Chopped White or Yellow Onion
•	3/4 tsp. of EACH Cinnamon, Chili Powder, Garlic Powder, and Salt
Maple Dijon Sauce
•	1/3 c. Maple Syrup
•	1/3 c. Dijon Mustard

","
Preparation
This sweet take on veggie burgers is sure to impress your family and friends. Makes 4 Burgers or 8 mini Patties!

First, roast two large or three medium sized sweet potatoes (poked several times with a fork) in a 375 degree oven for about 45 – 60 minutes. They’ll be very soft and fork tender when they’re done. You may not need to use ALL of the cooked sweet potato.
Next, combine the water and ground flaxseed in a small bowl and then set it aside for now.
In a medium-sized bowl, place your garbanzo beans and mash them up with a potato masher or large fork, leaving some beans partially intact.
To the same bowl, add your cooked sweet potato, dry oats, 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs, onion, spices and salt. Finally, add the flaxseed/water mixture and then stir it all together.
Form this mixture into four equal-sized patties. Then, coat each side with breadcrumbs and put them in a lightly oiled pan over medium-high heat.
While those patties are cooking, prep your Maple Dijon Sauce by combining the maple syrup and mustard in a small bowl.
After approximately 5 – 7 minutes, flip the burgers.
While you’re waiting for the second side to cook, prep your other toppings. I like to use lettuce, tomato and sometimes a bit of sliced avocado!
Once those burgers form a nice crispy brown surface on each side, remove them from the pan and sprinkle them with a small pinch of salt and pepper.
If you’re like me and love a toasted bun, now would be the time to place those buns in the hot pan to lightly toast on each side.
The last step? Place those burgers on your buns, drizzle with plenty of Maple Dijon Sauce, load up your toppings, and enjoy!
This recipe can also be used to make a killer appetizer or side dish! Just form the mixture into small cakes instead of patties.

1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/3 cup brown rice flour
For bitty buns:
1 1/2 cups water, warmed to between 110-120 degrees F
2 teaspoons agave nectar
4 teaspoons active dry yeast
3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vital wheat gluten

","
Preparation
Homemade veggie burgers can be a challenge to some! Vegetable patties can be cooked by baking, frying, or grilling. For this recipe, I formed the patties the night before and then froze them in order to make them grillable. This actually worked really well. Note, however, that I grilled them in a grill pan, not on an outdoor grill. Your results may vary.

Method

To make the patties, combine one half of the beans and one half of the rice in a food processor. Add the oil and salsa and process until mostly smooth. Combine with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Form into 8 patties with your hands. I roughly measured them as 1/3 cup of patty mix each. Wrap in waxed paper or parchment paper and let freeze in a container or on a flat surface in a plastic bag.
To make the bitty burger buns, combine the warm water, agave, and yeast and whisk until combined, just a few seconds. Let stand 10 minutes until proofed. Combine with the remaining ingredients and mix until dough forms. Knead until smooth. Add more flour if too sticky. I added an additional two tablespoons. I also used my standing mixer for this, using the dough hook of course. I let the machine knead the dough for 3-4 minutes. If kneading by hand you may be looking at 5-7 minutes instead. Roll to a 1/2 inch thickness, then cut with a biscuit cutter into 12-16 rounds.
Sprinkle cornmeal on a couple of cookie sheets. Place the buns on the cookie sheets. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for one hour. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until browned on top.
When ready for the burgers, lightly oil a non-stick grill pan. Preheat over medium high heat. Cook each patty for 5-7 minutes, pushing down with a spatula occasionally for nice grill marks. Gently flip and cook for the same amount of time on the other side.
You don’t have to make all of the patties at once. Just keep them in the refrigerator until you’re ready for another!
Garnish with lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado, pickles, you name it.
Makes 8 patties, 12-16 buns.

Steak,Steak and Ale Pie,"
Ingredients

Jus-Roll frozen puff pastry (or similar) – ready rolled or blocks
One large white onion, sliced
A few cloves of garlic (more or less depending on how garlicky you like your food), chopped
Dried parsley, salt, pepper and any other of your favourite herbs.
5 – 6 large field mushrooms or around 10 smaller variety mushrooms. Chestnut mushrooms are lovely as they have a nice nutty flavour. Slice thickly
A pack of Fry’s thick-cut chunky strips (or other beef substitute)
Bisto original gravy granules or other vegan granules
A cup of Vegan ale – Check Barnivore, a great vegan alcohol website. If you don’t drink alcohol, replace with water.

","
Method

Fry the onion and garlic, herbs and seasoning in some oil until a little soft.
Add the mushrooms and “meat” strips and fry until the strips start to look browned
Add the ale and sprinkle in the gravy granules, a tablespoon at a time until it starts to thicken. Make sure the gravy isn’t watery, as it will make the pastry really soggy. It just needs to cover the ingredients in the pan.
Roll out the pastry, line a roasting dish with it and place the pie filling in the dish. Place the pastry on the top and squash the edges of the bottom layer and the top of the pie together with a fork. If you want less pastry, you can leave off the bottom layer and just have the top. Don’t worry if it looks a mess, when the pastry puffs up, it will look fab! And if the gravy overflows and runs out, even better!
Cook at 200 degrees for about half an hour, or until the pastry looks nice and brown.

Stew,Aubergine Chickpea Stew with Fresh Flatbreads,"
Ingredients

For the Stew:
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, finely sliced
4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
1 tsp fresh parsley stalks
½ tsp ground cumin
½ tsp ground coriander
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp smoked paprika
¼ tsp ground cloves
2 aubergines (eggplant) (approx 600g), halved lengthways then sliced into 1cm semicircles
1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained (keep the liquid to use for aquafaba in another recipe)
2 x 400g tins peeled plum tomatoes
1 Tbsp light brown sugar
500ml vegetable stock
Juice of 1 lemon
For the Flatbreads:
130g strong white bread flour
350g plain white flour
1 tsp fine sea salt
300ml lukewarm water
2 tsp quick yeast
1 tsp sugar

","
Method
To Make the Stew:

Preheat the oven to 200c (fan).
Place a cast-iron dutch oven (with lid) over a medium/low heat and add the oil.
Once the pan is to temperature, add the onion and fry lightly for a minute. Add the garlic and parsley stalks before frying for a further 2 minutes. Do not allow the onions or garlic to brown.
Add the spices and stir well to coat the onion. Add the aubergine, chickpeas, tinned tomatoes, brown sugar, and vegetable stock. Stir well.
Cover the pot with the lid and place in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, removing to stir every half hour.
While the stew cooks, make the flatbreads.

To Make the Flatbreads:

Combine the flours and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. If you don’t have a stand mixer, just use a medium sized bowl.
Place 100 ml of the water into a small bowl and add the sugar and yeast. Mix well and set aside to allow the yeast to bloom.
Mix the yeast mixture into the flour along with the rest of the water. If using a stand mixer, knead using the dough hook attachment for roughly 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth. If kneading by hand, sprinkle a counter with flour and knead vigorously for 8-10 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea-towel and leave to proof somewhere room temperature for at least one hour.
Once proofed, punch down the dough to remove the larger air bubbles.
Lightly flour a rimmed baking tray. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and slice the dough into 8 even pieces. Roll them into tight balls and place on the floured tray to prove, covered with a damp tea-towel. Leave to proof a second time for around 40 minutes.
Once proofed, roll out each ball to around 15cm. Place a dry, cast-iron skillet over medium heat.
Place one flatbread in the skillet and cook until puffed and bubbly. Flip after around 3 minutes, making sure the bottom isn’t burning. Cook for a further minute or two on the second side before removing. Repeat with all of the flatbreads. Wrap the cooked flatbreads in a clean tea-towel to keep them warm.

Stew,Irish Vegetable Stew,"
Ingredients

1 turnip (or swede if you’re from outside of Ireland)
2 large onions (or 4 small ones…)
4 celery stalks
2 large carrots (or 4 small ones…)
2 parsnips
500ml veg stock made with 2 vegetable stock cubes
1 tbsp soya butter
1 tbsp Herbes de Provence
1 dsp (dessert spoon) flour
Salt (optional) and black pepper

","
Method

Wash and peel all the veg and cut them into large chunks at an angle.


Melt the butter in a large sauce pan and add the chopped onions once melted.


Cook the onions until they soften and are coated in the butter. Around 4 minutes maybe.


Add the herbs then and stir to coat the onions in the herbs.


Then add the flour and stir to make sure this mixture doesn’t stick to the pan. Let the flour and the herbs cook with the onions for a few minutes so the butter absorbs the flavour.


Then add the stock very slowly. Add in just a little bit at a time stirring all the time. This will form a kind of gravy-like liquid.


Then add in the rest of the vegetables and if you think the mixture needs more liquid just add in a bit more boiling water.


Add some black pepper and salt if you think it needs it (I didn’t use salt).


Put a lid on then and let it simmer on a low heat for around an hour or until the veg are cooked.


Serve with spuds anyway you like!

Pie,Mince and Onion Pie,"
Ingredients

500 g soya mince. I used Granose soya mince
1 onion, chopped
1 -2 tablespoons of oil
250ml of vegan gravy (keep it quite thick). If you can’t find any, then you could use vegetable stock and gravy browning.
1 Tbsp. ketchup
2 teaspoons Henderson’s relish (or vegan Worcestershire sauce)
Black pepper (to taste, I used a lot)
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
1 pack of ready to roll shortcrust pastry (Jus-Rol is vegan)
1 pack of ready to roll puff pastry (Jus-Rol is vegan)

 
","
Preparation
The filling can also be frozen and then used at a future date. 

Method
The filling:

Finely chop the onion and soften in a large pan with the oil.


Once softened, add the soya mince and cook-off, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. The kind of soya mince I used needed to be rehydrated first so make sure you follow the instructions for that. If you are using frozen, break it up a bit and add it to the pan.


Add in the gravy, ketchup, Henderson’s, pepper and oregano to the pan. Stir it all together then cook over a medium heat. Try to reduce the mixture down so that it’s not too wet. You should be able to drag a spoon through the pan and have the mixture stay apart for a few seconds.


This can then be refrigerated until you are ready to use it. It will freeze too so you can make lots this time and then defrost ahead of time in the future.

The pie:

Get your pie dish or dishes ready and roll out the shortcrust pastry as per the instructions so you have enough to cover the bottom and the sides of your dish. This is a proper pie, not a stew with a puff pastry hat on.


Line the bottom and sides of your dish with the pastry and then blind bake at 200C for around 15 mins until the pastry turns golden. You can prick the pastry on the bottom of the pan with a knife to stop it rising up and help it cook a little better.


While your pastry is blind baking, you can roll out your puff pastry for the top as per the instructions on the packet.


Once your shortcrust is ready, add the filling and then place the puff pastry on top. Crimp around the edges and then make a couple of holes in the top with a sharp knife to let the steam out.


Brush with soya milk (or other non-sweet plant milk) and bake at 200C for around 30 mins or until the top is lovely and golden.

Shawarma,Mushroom Shawarma,"
Ingredients

5 Portobello mushrooms, de-stemmed (save stems for another recipe)
2–3 Tbsp everyday olive oil
2 Tbsp vegan butter
Shawarma Blend:
1 Tbsp cumin
1 Tbsp paprika
1/2 tsp cayenne
2 tsp cinnamon
1 Tbsp granulated onion
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp Sea salt
Fresh cracked Pepper
(optional: 1 Tbsp dried ginger)
Tzatziki:
1 cup plain yoghurt (Kite Hill)
2 Tbsp mint, finely chopped
1–2 garlic clove, crushed and finely chopped
1–2 Tbsp lemon zest
Pinch of salt
All the fixins:
Cucumber, thinly sliced
Cherry tomatoes halved
Parsley
Arugula (rocket)
Warm pitta breads
Harissa Sauce

","
Method

Get a pan ripping hot and add a little oil. Place mushrooms, stem facing down, on a baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Place mushrooms, stem facing up, onto the hot pan, and add another pan on top for the pressing step.
Allow the weight of the pan to press them gently and apply gentle pressure using a tea towel once softened (you want them to soften, before properly pressing them, otherwise they break). As soon as you start to see water being released, start to apply more pressure. Turn and press on the other side, until they are half the size of the raw mushroom. (The whole pressing process will take between 8-10 minutes). Repeat for remaining mushrooms until caramelized on edges.
Combine all spices and seasonings in a small bowl and coat the stem side of the mushroom with the blend. Flip over and repeat, coating with the spices. Use a spoon to push the seasoning into the surface of the mushrooms.
Heat up a pan on medium heat and coat surface liberally with vegan butter. Saute mushrooms in a pan and blacken on both sides.
Make Tzatziki; Mix plain yoghurt, mint, garlic clove (crushed and finely chopped), lemon zest, and salt in a bowl.
Prep your side vegetables, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh parsley
Remove mushrooms from the pan and chop into thin slices, reminiscent of kebab meat.
Warm pitta bread in the oven and wrap in a tea towel, assemble your shawarma on a plate, topped with Tzatziki, arugula, mushrooms, tomatoes, sliced cucumber, parsley, and harissa.
Serve and enjoy!

Stew,Vegan Feijoada,"
Ingredients
400g of black beans cooked in water with a bay leaf and chopped garlic (keep the cooking liquid)
4 cloves of garlic
2 medium sized onions
2-3 cups of mixed vegetables, we used courgettes, squash, carrots and tomatoes
200g of firm tofu (optional)
1 tbsp of smoked paprika
1 tbsp of vegan stock
For the vinaigrette:
4 tomatoes
Salt and pepper
Handful of herbs (such as parsley, basil, as you prefer)
Olive oil
Juice of 1 lime
1 red onion
For the Farofa:
200g Farofa flour (usually found in South America or West African supermarkets)
1 clove of garlic chopped finely
1 small onion chopped finely
To Garnish:
1 orange, cut into segments
1 spring onion
","
Method

Fry the onions and garlic in oil in a big pan for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, and then add the chopped vegetables.


After a couple of minutes, add the black beans still in their cooking liquid, stock, and paprika. Leave to cook for 10 minutes. Check the feijoada occasionally to make sure all the liquid hasn’t evaporated, and to give it a quick stir.


Add the tofu cubes if using, and cook for a further 5 minutes. Be careful not to stir too much at this point, otherwise the tofu cubes can break up.


While the tofu is cooking (in the feijoada) you can make the farofa. Put the onion and garlic in hot oil. When the onion and garlic are golden, add the farofa flour and cook for approximately 5 minutes, mixing all the time.


To serve put a few spoonfuls of feijoada on a plate, cover with finely chopped spring onions and the farofa. Serve with some of the vinaigrette and orange segments. Traditionally feijoada is also served with rice.

Fish Fingers,Vegan Fish Fingers,"
Ingredients

Step 1 ingredients:
Plenty of cooking oil
Sushi sheets
Step 2 ingredients:
250g extra firm tofu
150g artichoke hearts in oil
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Step 3 ingredients:
80g chickpea flour
5 tbsp nutritional yeast
(2 tbsp olive oil)
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
Step 4 ingredients:
Breadcrumbs (e.g. gluten-free ones)
Optional ingredients:
Lemons
Peas
Ketchup
vegan Mayo
Potatoes salad
Chips

","
Method
Step 1:
Pour cooking oil into a pan and add 1 pack of sushi nori sheets to infuse the oil. The longer you leave them in the better: e.g. you could soak them in the morning and then cook the vegan fish fingers in the evening for a more intense taste. Alternatively, if you don’t have much time heat them up a bit for 5 minutes so they give up more flavour. Make sure the heat isn’t too high because they burn easily.
Step 2:
Place ingredients of step 2 into a food processor until you get a semi-smooth mixture.
Step 3:
Transfer the mixture into a large bowl and add all other ingredients from this step and mix. Make sure there are no chickpea flour lumps, otherwise the fish fingers might taste bitter.
Form fish finger shapes. Alternatively, just form sausage shapes. Admittedly it was a bit of work to make rectangular shapes and when they were fried they lost their shape a bit anyway. So if you want to make your life easier, roll them into a sausage shape, it won’t make a difference in terms of taste. They will be quite soft at this stage, but don’ worry they will firm up when fried.
Step 4:
Add breadcrumbs to a bowl and roll the vegan fish fingers in them until they are covered on all sides.
Take the sushi sheets out of the pan with cooking oil and heat up the pan. Fry the fish fingers in the pan until they are golden brown. Place on a kitchen towel to soak up the excess oil.
Optionally drizzle some lemon juice on top when serving the fish fingers. Have cooked peas, chips or potato salad and ketchup or vegan mayo on the side. Enjoy!

·         To season: black pepper, nutritional yeast

","
Preparation
Serves 4.
Preheat the oven to 220°C / 425°F / Gas Mark 7.
I use an enamel cast-iron casserole dish for this recipe, however you could just as easily prepare the sauce in a pan on the hob and transfer to an oven dish for baking.
Puy lentils also go by the name of ‘Lentilles Vertes’ and can be found tinned, dried or vacuum packed in most supermarkets.

Method

Place a heavy-based casserole dish on the hob and heat the oil on a moderate to high heat. Chop the onion, garlic, mushrooms, carrot and rosemary leaves and add these to the oil, stirring.


Leave to sauté for 5 minutes, or until the onions soften.


Stir in the chilli flakes, smoked paprika, cinnamon, coriander seeds and pumpkin seeds, followed by the red wine, vinegar, tamari, tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and water. Simmer for 10 minutes.


While this is bubbling away, slice the potatoes as thinly as you can.


Now add the lentils, spinach and black pepper to the sauce and give it a good stir. Remove from the heat and arrange the potato slices to cover the dish in any pattern you like. If you are using nutritional yeast, sprinkle onto the potato topping.


Cover the dish and cook in the oven for 20 minutes.


Remove the lid and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes. The potatoes should be cooked through and nicely crisp.


Serve with lovely steamed greens or a fresh salad.

Chicken,Beer Battered Chicken Bites,"
Ingredients

1/2 cup of chicken-style pieces
1 1/2 cup plain flour
1tsp baking powder
1 x 375ml of chilled vegan beer/lager (I used Coors Light but as long as it is vegan feel free to choose your personal favourite)
1/2tsp each of salt
pepper
onion powder and garlic powder
2tsp dried mixed herbs
Around 400ml of oil for frying but the exact amount depends on the size of your fryer.

","
Preparation

You’ll need to pre-heat the oil in your deep fryer.
If your chicken-style pieces are frozen then begin by defrosting them ready for use.


Method
Add together all of the dry ingredients – flour, baking powder and dried seasonings – and combine well.
Make a well in the centre of the dried ingredients and add the bottle of chilled beer. Stir well to combine until a smooth batter has formed.
You can drop a small amount of batter into the frying oil if you need to check to see if it is hot enough. The oil will sizzle and the batter begin to puff up if the oil is indeed hot enough.
Dip the chicken-style pieces into the batter and, once fully coated, drop carefully into the oil. You may need to do this in several batches if you have only a small fryer so be patient and be sure not to overcrowd the fryer because the batter needs enough room to properly cook.
Fry for 5 minutes or so, until crispy and golden in appearance, and then transfer to a paper towel in order to remove the oily residue.
Serve up as a side dish to any Chinese meal, with chips and ketchup or even as a snack on its own with sweet chilli sauce.

2 tbsp shoyu or tamari (natural soy sauce)
3 to 4 tbsp whole wheat flour

","
Method
Preheat the grill to medium/hot. Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the flour and fold until you achieve a consistency that glues the ingredients together adding a little more flour if required.
Using your hands make the burgers with two tbsp of the mixture.  Place the burgers on a foil lined grill tray and grill for 15 minutes, turning halfway through. Serve with some toasted sourdough crusty bread spread with vegan mayonnaise. Top with your favourite chutney, sliced avocado, cucumber, tomatoes and some fresh greens.
If you enjoy a smoked taste add 1 tsp of smoked paprika to the mixture.
Alternatively; fry the burgers in a heavy based frying pan and use organic sunflower oil.

BBQ Pulled Pork,Club Mexicana’s BBQ Pulled Jackfruit,"
Ingredients

2 jalapeños, finely chopped
2 tbsp vegetable oil
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tbsp chilli powder
2 tsp cumin
0.5 tsp cayenne
500ml ketchup
125ml (1/2 cup) lime juice (more if you like it tangy)
1 cup dark brown sugar
4 tins (cans) of jackfruit in brine
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp dijon mustard

","
Method

Fry the garlic & jalapeños in oil for a minute. Add all the spices, stir and cook until fragrant (a minute or so). Add ketchup, lime and brown sugar. Stir until all the sugar has melted. Partially cover and keep cooking on a low heat until sauce has thickened to the consistency of ketchup.


Drain and thoroughly rinse the tinned jackfruit. Use your hands to tear the strands of jackfruit from the harder core. The fruit will come apart very easily. Put the pulled jackfruit into a bowl and put the cores into another bowl. Once everything has been pulled apart use a knife to finely chop the harder cores. It doesn’t matter if these are still a bit chunky once chopped as it adds more texture to the dish.


Heat oil in pan and add the pulled jackfruit. Cook until it gets a bit grey and loses some moisture. Add the dijon mustard and stir in. Add a little water if it starts to stick to the pan.


Add about half the BBQ sauce (more if you want a very sticky dish) and stir in to coat. Cook until it’s almost starting to get a little crispy and sticking to the pan a little.


Spoon on top of warm corn tacos and top with cos lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, a squeeze of fresh lime and a sprinkle of coriander.

Cheese,Non-Dairy Gorgonzola,"
Ingredients

½ block (7 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu (not silken tofu)
¼ cup organic refined coconut oil (not virgin coconut oil)
2 tbsp mellow white miso paste
4 tsp white wine or champagne vinegar
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt
½ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp garlic powder
⅛ tsp blue-green algae powder (spirulina)

","
Preparation

For this cheese you will need a glass, ceramic, metal or BPA-free plastic container which will hold a minimum of 1 and ½ cup liquid; this will act as the form to shape the cheese. This recipe yields about 8 ounces.


Method
Line the form with plastic wrap or a double-layer of cheesecloth, being sure to leave some excess hanging over the sides. This will help lift the cheese from the form after firming.
Drain and press the tofu until it is not releasing any more liquid. It is essential to dry the tofu as much as possible for the proper texture. Crumble the tofu into a food processor.
Remove the metal lid from the jar of coconut oil and place the jar in a microwave. Heat just until the solid oil liquefies, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (this will depend upon the solidity of the coconut oil). Alternately, place the jar in about an inch of simmering water and melt the oil in the same manner. Measure ¼ cup and add to the food processor with the remaining ingredients except for the algae powder. Process the contents until very smooth.
Transfer the cheese mixture to a bowl. Dot the cheese in several spots with the algae powder and fold (rather than stir) the cheese over a few times to create swirls of blue-green color. Transfer the cheese to the lined form. Pack the mixture with the back of a spoon and smooth the surface as best you can. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours. This will ensure that the coconut oil has completely solidified.
Lift the cheese from the container and slice or crumble as needed. Store the cheese wrapped in plastic wrap or in a zip-lock bag in the refrigerator. Because this cheese is made with miso, a fermented product, the flavor will continue to develop as it ages. Try aging the cheese for a minimum of one week before using for the best flavor.

Chicken,Hot Fried Maitake Chicken,"
Ingredients

1 lb / 450g Maitake Mushroom clusters
1 Cup / 250ml Oil for frying
3 Cups / 375g Panko breadcrumbs
3 Cups / 375g Crumbled BBQ potato chips
3 Cups / 375g Flour
1 Tbsp salt, coarse grind Sea Salt
1 Tbsp poultry seasoning
1 Tbsp black pepper, fine grind
3 Cups / 360ml Follow Your Heart Vegan Egg wash mixture
1/2 Cup / 120ml hot sauce

","
Preparation
Serves 4

Method

Heat cast iron skillet or heavy-duty saucepan to med heat. On 1/2 sheet pan lay out all mushrooms in whole clusters, drizzle and lightly dab 1 t of oil to the mushrooms. Apply a light coat in which the seasoning will stick to, sprinkle dry seasoning then add to heated cast iron pan and weigh down with additional cast iron pan, a brick wrapped in tin foil or heavier cover to create a press. Cook for 2 -3 minutes then flip over being careful not to tear the mushroom breasts. Sprinkle a bit more of seasoning and then press with pan again. Repeat this process several times until mushrooms are condensed and pressed into light golden brown pieces with no liquid in the pan.

NOTE: Depending on the mushrooms (cause they’re all different) some will leach more liquid than others. Don’t fret it might take a couple minutes longer to cook but the liquid will dissipate. After they are pressed and golden, remove mushrooms from heat and cool.

In medium-size bowl or container add pressed shrooms and Haute sauce to marinate for at least an hour or overnight.
In three separate bowls get the breading station ready.

Seasoned flour with a little salt and pepper
Make Vegan egg wash mixture by following directions on Follow Your Heart Vegan Egg
Make panko crumb crust by adding panko, BBQ potato chips, and seasoning to food processor and pulse until coarse grind consistency.


Lightly dredge each piece of shroom, first in flour to coat, then in vegan egg mixture, then in seasoned panko, so it’s fully coated.
In medium cast iron pan add oil so it’s between 1/4 & 1/2-inch deep and heat on medium heat, once hot begin to fry each piece for several minutes on each side until golden brown, when done let sit on newspaper or paper bag to catch excess oil.

NOTE: if you’re doing a big batch and allow to cool – pieces may be reheated before serving by assembling on a baking sheet and reheat in a 350-degree oven for 5 – 10 minutes until hot.

Chicken,Vegan Fried Chicken,"
Ingredients

Homemade Seitan
For the coating – Flour:
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp dried marjoram
2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp dried sage
2 tbsp paprika
2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
Kosher salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄4 cup corn starch
½ tsp baking powder
For the buttermilk:
1 cup vegan buttermilk (1 cup of soya milk and 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, whisked together and left to sit for 5 – 10 mins)
1 tsp hot sauce
Pinch of salt
Oil for frying

","
Preparation
Make the seitan following the instructions below:

There are loads of recipes for seitan and I am working my way through them, learning as I go. For this recipe I tried one by Isa Chandra (Chicken Stylee Seitan, available on thePPK.com) and because it was a big batch I tried a couple of different ways of cooking it. I think either way would work and I would definitely try the boiled method for this recipe next time.


I followed the recipe by Isa Chandra up to the point of cooking. At that point, I separated the seitan dough in to two batches. With one, I followed the recipe, gentry cooking the seitan in stock. This was the most successful of my attempts so far. It is really, really important not to let it boil. I got all tech about it and dragged out the jam thermometer. I kept it between 94 and 98 degrees.


Anyway, for this particular version, I took the other half of the seitan and formed it in to small nuggets. Keep them on the small side because they will expand on cooking. I put them on an oiled baking tray and covered them with tin foil and baked for 20 – 30 mins at 180oC. Keep an eye on them, they are only small so it won’t take much to burn them. My thinking with this was that it keep them dry and therefore make the coating stick better.


If you have the time, the stock method would work too but you would want to leave them to drain for quite a while and get as much stock out of them as you can before trying to do the coating.


If you don’t fancy making your own seitan or you have your own preferred product or recipe, you could just use that. If you are still searching for that perfect recipe, give Isa’s recipe a go.


Method

You will need 2 bowls and a drying rack to complete all of the coating process and to also drain off the seitan once cooked.


Start off by making the vegan butter milk. Combine the ingredients and then let sit for 5 to 10 mins whilst you get all the ingredients for the flour together and mix them well in a bowl. By the time you have got them all sorted, your buttermilk should be good to go.


In your second bowl, mix the buttermilk with the hot sauce and salt. You are now ready to being the coating process.


Add the seitan to the buttermilk and let soak for 10 mins. One soaked, add the pieces a few at a time to the flour and coat well before putting on the drying rack and leaving for another 5 to 10 mins. You can use this time to get your oil heated up. You want it at 180oC. Be careful, don’t burn your house down or anything.


Once the seitan pieces have sat in the coating for 10 mins, we repeat the coating process. This helps more of the flour stick and also creates all sort of lumps, bumps and crevices which are going to make this really good. Straight in to the buttermilk, straight in to the flour and then in to the 180oC oil.


The most important tip I found was to leave the pieces along for at least 3 minutes otherwise you risk knocking the coating off. Overall mine took about 8 mins to get nice and golden. My pan was not big enough to cook the whole lot and yours probably won’t be either so I did a couple of batches and kept the first batch warm in a low oven. I chucked the first batch in the oil again for a minute at the end, just because.

Lasagne,Roasted Aubergine Lasagne,"

2 tbsp tomato puree
2 aubergines
1 carrot, diced
4 cloves of garlic
1 stick of celery, diced
1 large onion, diced
1 red pepper
Dark soy sauce, 2 tbsp
Vegetable stock, 1 pt good quality vegetable bouillion works best
Small sprig of fresh thyme, 2 bay leaves and handful of fresh marjoram
400ml almond or soy milk
2 tbsp plain flour
40g vegan margarine
120g grated hard vegan cheese such as vegan parmesan

Method
Sauté 1/2 of the onion and one clove of crushed garlic in olive oil until softened. Add puy lentils, sauté for a further minute then add 1 1/2 to 2 pints of stock and simmer until lentils are fully cooked and soft. Add further stock as needed. You are aiming for them to absorb most of the liquid without leaving too much broth.
 
Remove the hard core of the tomatoes and place whole on a baking tray, along with 3 garlic cloves. Roast on high heat until well roasted and starting to blacken. Blitz with handblender. Set aside.
 
Remove ends and slice aubergines lengthways, approx 1.5cm thickness. Drizzle with olive oil and salt and pepper. Roast on high heat until golden brown and soft. Set aside.
 
Sauté the remaining onion, carrot, red pepper, and celery, then add cooked lentils, soy, one bay leaf, a handful of fresh marjoram, and a sprig of thyme. Add blended tomato sauce (or tinned tomatoes and garlic if using) and the tomato puree. Bring to boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper, then taste to check seasoning and adjust according to taste.
 
Heat butter in a small pan, add a pinch of salt and plain flour and cook to make a roux, gently cooking the paste for 2-3 minutes. Then slowly add milk, whisking all the time until reach a creamy consistent sauce. Add a bay leaf, and simmer for 2 minutes.
 
Layer some bechamel sauce on the bottom of a large deep baking dish and cover with pasta. Then layer over lentil and tomato mix, followed by a layer of roasted aubergine, allowing the aubergine to overlap to create a nice thick layer. Add another layer of lentil mix and then top with another layer of pasta, on top of the pasta pour creamy béchamel sauce. Sprinkle top with cheese and salt and pepper.
 
Bake in a medium hot oven at 190 C for 30-40 mins until bubbling and top is golden brown. Serve with a fresh green salad.

Falafel,Turmeric & Sweet Potato Falafels,"
Ingredients

240g/8½oz chickpeas (or 1 tin drained)
300g/10oz sweet potatoes (or 1 medium sized)
2 large cloves garlic
1 handful fresh coriander leaves
¼ teaspoon ground cardamon
heaped teaspoon ground turmeric (or 1 heaped tablespoon of freshly grated)
2 teaspoons heaped ground coriander
1 teaspoon heaped ground cumin
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 heaped teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons gram flour (chickpea flour)
Extra gram flour for rolling with

","
Method

Scrub and chop the sweet potato and boil until soft with skin still included (approximately 10 minutes). Then drain and place in a mixing bowl.
Crush garlic and chop along with coriander leaves (as small as you can) with a sharp knife.
Add all ingredients into blender or food processor (EXCEPT the gram flour). I find this actually works best  with a hand (immersion) blender. With a hand blender, you can apply downward pressure and get in there nicely… if you use a jug blender or food processor it will work fine if you keep scraping down the sides and loosen the mixture. Alternatively you could go for the real rustic effect and use a strong potato masher to do the job instead. Blend until most of the mixture is broken down. It doesn’t need to be totally smooth; it can be quite rustic.
Once blended add the gram flour and continue to mix in with a spoon. If you leave it on the side for a while (half and hour or half a day) then it will firm up a little making it slightly easier to roll. I sometimes let it stand if I have time, but that’s not essential.
 Chickpea moisture varies from batch to batch. The mixture should be soft and pliable, easy to roll into a ball in your hands. Take a heaped teaspoon worth of mixture and roll a small ball (this should be smaller than a golf ball). The delightful yellowness glow of the turmeric will rub off a bit on your hands. If you’d rather now yellow-out your hands then use extra gram flour to roll with. If your mixture is too soft to roll well, then add a little extra gram flour or use gram flour to roll in.
Place on a lightly oiled baking tray and bake in preheated oven at gas mark 6 or 7 (200˚C to 220˚C/ 400˚F to 425˚F) for approximately 30 minutes or until tanned.
Enjoy!

Bacon,Tempeh Bacon Bowl,"
Ingredients

For the tempeh bacon:
200g tempeh
1 tbsp maple syrup
4 tbsp soy
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tsp liquid smoke
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp chilli flakes
For the squash:
1 squash (I used butternut, but acorn squash would also be great)
2 tsp maple syrup
1 tsp coconut oil (solid)
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp sweet paprika
5 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
For the freekeh:
100g freekeh
500ml water

4 cloves garlic, sliced
250g mushrooms, chopped
5 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
For the chickpeas:
1 tin chickpeas

5 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
Other:
5-10g wakame
300g spring greens (or other leafy greens)
2 medium tomatoes
(Avocado and pickles are also great additions!)
For the dressing:
1 inch fresh ginger
1 tbsp peanut butter
1 red chilli
3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
2 tbsp white miso
1 tsp maple syrup
2 tbsp soy
½ lime (juice)
2 tbsp water
 

","
Preparation
Serves two to three as a main meal
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
 

Method

At least 2 hours in advance: prepare the bacon by slicing the tempeh as thinly as you can and coat it with the marinade ingredients.
Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
To prepare the squash, use a sharp knife to top and tail it and then cut lengthways down the middle. Scoop out the seeds and stringy bits using a spoon. Slice a criss-cross pattern across the flesh and drizzle the maple syrup and oil onto each half, followed by the seasoning.
Cook for 45 minutes to an hour. It should turn a lovely caramelised brown, and be soft, but not mushy. Once cooked, slice into chunks.
Combine the chickpeas, oil and seasoning in an oven proof dish and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking.
Arrange the tempeh bacon slices on a flat tray, lined with parchment paper, and pour over any remaining marinade. Place the tray in the oven and cook for 20-30 minutes, turning once.
While the squash, chickpeas and tempeh are cooking, prepare the freekeh by simmering in water for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat the oil in a large pan and sautée the garlic, mushrooms and thyme until lightly browned. Add the freekeh, stir and take off the heat.
Once the oven-cooked ingredients are almost done, slice the greens into ribbons and steam until soft. Rehydrate the wakame according to the packet and slice thinly. Slice the tomatoes.
To make the dressing, combine all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth.
You’re now ready to assemble the bowl! I like to start with the freekeh and greens, then layer in sections, finishing with the dressing.

Bolognese sauce,Tempeh Bolognese,"
Ingredients
For the Bolognese sauce
250g tempeh
250g field mushrooms or any other is fine
1 stick celery finely chopped
1 medium carrot finely chopped
1 onion finely chopped
4 cloves garlic
20g tomato puree
200ml red wine
1 canned chopped tomatoes or 400g
300ml passata
100ml water
Few sprigs rosemary and thyme finely chopped
","
Method

Start to pulse the mushrooms as they need to be pureed. Remove and place into a bowl.
Do the same to the tempeh, but this needs to be a bit chunkier. Place it in with the mushrooms.
Add the mushroom and tempeh into the pan, turn the heat up to cook out the mushroom water. This will do two things: give a deep colour and intensify the flavours.
Once the mushroom water has been cooked out and evaporated, transfer the mix out of the pan and drain in the colander.
In the same large pan, add some olive oil. Add the finely chopped veggies and cook slowly, releasing all those beautiful aromas and flavours. Then in with the garlic and cook for a further 2-3mins.
Add the finely chopped thyme and rosemary and continue to cook for a few minutes.
Go in with the tomato puree, cook out slowly for 3 mins. Finely add the red wine and turn the heat up to deglaze the pan with all the caramelized sediment that’s on the bottom of the pan – this is where all the natural flavour is.
Reduce to cook out the alcohol and add the tempeh and mushroom mixture back into the pan. Give the mix a good stir.
Add the canned tomatoes, passata and water. Give it a good stir.
Season with salt and pepper cook for 10 mins.
Have a pan of boiling water ready to cook the pasta. Mix and emulsify the Bolognese sauce with the cooked pasta.
Finish with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.
Serve and enjoy!

Satay,Tofu Satay With Peanut Sauce,"
Ingredients

MARINADE
2 lemongrass stalks, trimmed and finely chopped
15g (7 1/2 teaspoons) fresh root ginger, finely chopped
2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
1 red chilli, deseeded if you like it less hot, finely chopped
1.5 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp ground tumeric
1/2 tsp agave 
3 tsbp tamari or soy sauce
1 tbsp rapeseed oil or olive oil
PEANUT SATAY SAUCE
100g (6 Tbsp) smooth peanut butter
140ml (about 1/2 cup) coconut milk
3/4 tbsp tamari or soya sauce
2 tsp lime juice
1/2 tsp chilli flakes
1 1/2 tbsp protein powder (optional)
2 lime wedges

","
Method
 

If you are using wooden skewers, soak them for about 20-30 mins in cold water so that they do not burn when you cook the satay


Make the marinade – Finely chop the lemon grass, root ginger, chillies and mix with crushed garlic in a bowl. Add the ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, agave syrup, lime juice, tamari/soya sauce and rapeseed or olive oil. Alternatively, you can blitz this all in a food processor to form a paste


Prepare the protein – Slice the tofu into thick slices about 1.5cm thick (or cubes if you are skewering them)


Make the satay – Put the peanut butter, coconut milk, chilli flakes, tamari or soya sauce, lime juice and protein powder of choice into a small saucepan and on a low heat melt the peanut butter and mix all the ingredients together to form a thick sauce. Pour into a bowl and decorate with 2 slices of fresh red chilli


Coat the tofu with the satay marinade for at least 30 mins in the fridge


Grill marinated tofu slices for about 4-5 mins each side. (Note: these are also great on the barbecue)


Season with a twist of ground black pepper. Serve with warm protein peanut satay sauce, wedges of lime (the sharpness contrasts beautifully with the creaminess and spicy marinade) and salad

4 cloves of garlic
1 sprig of rosemary
2 sprigs of thyme

Peppers,Stuffed Peppers,"
Ingredients

6 Bell Peppers
1 Small courgette
1 Small onion
3 Garlic cloves (crushed)
225g Brown rice
50g Currants
1 tsp Turmeric
1 tsp Cinnamon
½ tsp Sumac (optional)
1 litre Vegetable stock (I use Bouillon)
Olive oil
Salt and pepper

","
Preparation
Tips:

If your peppers don’t sit upright in the saucepan because there is space around them, then squeeze an onion or a potato in next to them to make them sit tight.


Add some olive oil to the pan of boiling water the peppers cook in. This will add a bit of flavour and soften them up nicely.


If you’d prefer to use white rice, just cut out the first stage. Add your rice into the onion mixture without pre-cooking it.


Method

Cook the brown rice for half of the time it suggests on the packet.


While the rice is cooking you can prep the peppers and filling – Wash the peppers and cut the tops off, making sure the green stalk is still attached so you can use the top of the pepper for a lid. De-seed and place all six in a saucepan so they stand upright. Set aside.


Dice the onion and gently fry in a medium sized frying pan with a little olive oil. Dice the courgette into small pieces and add to the pan along with the crushed garlic. Add the currants and spices.


By this time your rice should be ready. Drain it and add it to the pan. Stir to combine everything, turn up the heat and add your stock. Once it starts bubbling turn down to a low heat and let simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the rice has fully cooked. Add more liquid if needed. Once cooked, taste and season.


Spoon the rice into the peppers, filling them to the top, then place the top of the pepper back on. Repeat, so all six peppers are filled.


Carefully pour some boiling water into the saucepan, which the peppers are sitting in, making sure not to pour it over the peppers. The water should come up to about half the height of the peppers. Put a lid on, turn the hob onto a medium heat and let them simmer for 30 -45 minutes until the peppers have softened.

• 400g OmniPork Mince
• 100g OmniPork Strips
• 2 tablespoons corn starch
• Small bunch thyme
• Ground black pepper
• Sea salt
• Olive oil
• English mustard
• 320g ready roll sheet puff pastry
• 320g ready roll sheet puff pastry for lattice top (optional)
• Non-dairy milk
Mushroom Duxelle
• 300g chestnut mushrooms
• 1 small red onion
• 100g chestnuts (boiled or roasted and peeled)
• 1 sprig of thyme
","
Method
1. Roughly chop the OmniPork strips and add to the OmniPork mince. Season with salt and black pepper. Add the corn starch and mix well. Put in fridge to chill for 30 mins.
2. Use clingfilm to form the mince mixture into a log shape approximately 20cm in length. Leave in fridge to chill whilst preparing the mushroom duxelles.
3. For the mushroom duxelles, dice the mushrooms and onions finely (or use a food processor). Cook the diced mushrooms and onions over a medium heat, season with black pepper, salt and thyme leaves, until all the water is cooked off. Roughly chop the chestnuts and add to the mixture. Set aside and let it cool down completely.
4. Heat a pan with a good lug of oil and add a small bunch of thyme. Season the Omni log generously with black pepper and salt and sear all sides over high heat. Whilst the Omni log is still hot, use a pastry brush and cover it with mustard.
5. Unroll the puff pastry and spread the mushroom duxelles so that they will cover the entire Omni log once rolled over.
6. Place the Omni log on top of the mushroom duxelles and use a non-dairy milk to wash the edges of the puff pastry. Carefully roll over the puff pastry, covering the entire Omni log. Cut off any excess pastry and pinch to seal the ends.
7. Optional (skip to step 8)– Wash the pastry with non-diary milk and place a lattice pastry on top using the second pack of puff pastry roll. Wash the lattice work with non-dairy milk, season with salt and bake for 30mins in a preheated oven at 200c.
8. Preheat the oven to 200c. Wash the pastry with non-diary milk and, if not using a lattice top, carve the pastry with the back of a knife taking care not to cut through. Season with salt and place on an oiled baking tray. Cook for 30 mins.

8 oz package tempeh, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/3 red cabbage, thinly sliced

sesame seeds, garnish
cilantro, garnish, optional
grain of choice: rice, quinoa or soba noodles

Marinade

1/3 cup mirin
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons tamari, coconut aminos, nama shoyu or soy sauce
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste


","

Instructions


Marinade: In a large bowl, mix together the marinade, add the tempeh and let set for at least 15 minutes, up to 4 hours in the refrigerator, turning every so often. Reserve marinade for later.
Cook Tempeh: Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Spoon in the tempeh, reserving most of the glaze in the bowl (set aside for later). Saute for 6 – 8 minutes, turning on each side until browned.
Add veggies: Add the cabbage and carrots to the tempeh, cook for about 3 minutes, add scallions, a spoonful of marinade and cook another 2 minutes or until desired firmness (I like mine al dente). Add a tad more marinade as needed, reserve the rest to spoon over serving bowls.
Serve: In individual bowls, add 1/3 of the stir fry with a 1/2 or so of grain of choice – White or brown rice, quinoa or soba noodles would all be great. This Cilantro Lime Rice would be especially delicious! Top with any remaining sauce, sesame seeds and few extra scallions and cilantro.

1/2 heaping teaspoon baking soda (can be optional)
pinch of turmeric (will give it a yellow color), optional

juice of 1/2 small lemon or 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Add-ins:

2/3 cup greens (kale or spinach), julienned and loosely packed
small handful mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/2 shallot, finely diced
7 grape tomatoes, halved or quartered depending on the size


","

Instructions


Preheat griddle on medium.
Mix: In a medium size bowl, combine flour, water, baking soda, optional turmeric, cumin, garlic powder and salt to taste. Mix well ensuring all the flour lumps are gone. Add in lemon, stir and you will notice the batter rise and foam a bit. Add in veggies and combine thoroughly. (Note: I don’t really measure the vegetables, so this is an approximation)
Cook: Pour 1/2 of the mixture onto the preheated griddle or skillet. You can use your spatula to move the veggies around and flatten as needed if they are piled up in areas. Also you can help make your pancake round by gently pushing in the edges where needed. There may be times when it appears that you have more veggies than batter, don’t panic….in a few minutes the batter will puff up from the baking soda and fill in making it look fluffy and full. Let cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 – 7 minutes, making sure the batter cooks throughout.
Serve with your choice of condiments. A thinned hummus would also be great! Pairs well with fresh fruit on the side.
Makes 2 pancakes

Potato Topping

2 1/2 lbs. potatoes (yukon or russet), cut into 1 inch cubes
4 tablespoons vegan butter (my favorite it Miyoko’s) or olive oil
1/3 – 2/3 cup unsweetened, plain almond milk or vegan cream
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt + fresh cracked pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Potatoes: Cut potatoes into 1 inch cubes. Add potatoes to a large pot and cover with water (I added a few sprigs of thyme to the water.) Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes, add butter/oil, mash into potatoes to melt, add milk and stir until desired consistency. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and set aside in a warm place.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Filling: In a shallow pot or dutch oven, warm oil/water over medium heat, add onions, carrots, celery and garlic, saute for 5 minutes. Add thyme and rosemary, cook for 1 minute more. Add the lentils, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce and flour, mix well until flour is incorporated and no white streaks. Add the corn, peas, dijon, salt, pepper, and vegetable broth, simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for flavor and season with more salt and pepper to taste.
Assemble: Using the pot you cooked the vegetables or transfer to a 9 x 9 or 9 x 11 baking dish, evenly layer the mashed potato topping overtop, spreading from edge to edge. Leave as is, or make a pattern on the potatoes using the back of a fork, dragging it from edge to edge, then repeat in the other direction for a criss cross pattern.
Bake: If the baking dish seems very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn’t bubble over into your oven. Place in the oven and bake, uncovered, for 25 – 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
Serves 6
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days in a covered container. To store longer, keep in the freezer for 2 – 3 months.

1 can (14 oz) organic black beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup oats (rolled or quick)
1/4 cup flax meal or flour of choice (see notes)
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne or chipotle powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pink salt
1/4 cup chunky salsa or pico de gallo, give or take
1 tablespoon olive oil, for pan-frying
cornmeal, for dusting (I used coarse grind) (optional)


","

Instructions


Mash black beans: In a medium-size bowl, mash black beans with a strong fork or use a potato masher, leaving some chunks for texture if you like. 
Make patty mixture: Add oats, flour, spices, salt, and salsa, mix again, feel free to use your hands if you like to. If the mixture is too wet, add more flax meal/flour to the mix, but really it should be ok. Taste for flavor.
Shape patties: Divide the mixture and shape your patties into whatever size you like. I like to make 2 jumbo-sized burger patties, but you can make 3 – 4 smaller ones. Give a light dusting of cornmeal if you have it. It will give a nice crunch, flavor and cook up crispy.
Cook on the stovetop, oven, or grill:

Stovetop: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet on medium. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side. It’s ok if the cornmeal gets a little crispy. Trust me, it’s delicious!
Oven (oil-free): Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone mat. Place patties on a baking sheet, place in the oven on the center rack, and bake for 10 – 15 minutes, flip and repeat.

Serve with your choice of accompaniments such as red onion slices, leafy greens, salsa, or Vegan Mayo. Add some mashed avocado as a spread or sliced avocado if you prefer. Or serve on a bed of leafy greens. 
Makes 2 jumbo-sized patties or 3 – 4 smaller ones.

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
2 – 3 bay leaves
1 1/2 cups short grain rice (Valencia or arborio)
3 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1/2 – 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 can/jar (14 oz) artichoke hearts in water, drained and quartered
1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen, thawed)
chopped parsley leaves, to garnish
lemon wedges, to serve


","

Instructions


Steep saffron: In a small bowl, add the saffron threads to 3 tablespoons warm water, let set 10 minutes to steep. If using turmeric, skip this step and add turmeric with the other spices.
Saute: Heat olive oil/broth over medium heat in a large wide flat-bottomed pan or paella pan (a dutch oven or large pot would also suffice). Add onions and bell peppers, cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, green beans, tomatoes, smoked paprika, red pepper flakes and bay leaves, cook another 3 minutes stirring frequently. For softer veggies, cook another 7 minutes or so, totaling 10 minutes after adding the latter ingredients.
Add rice + broth: Add in the rice, broth, saffron mixture/turmeric and salt. Gently move the vegetables around so the rice falls to the bottom of the pan as much as possible. 
Boil + simmer: Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium or medium-low and cook at a continuous gentle boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice. If using a large paella pan (15 inches or so) you’ll want to rotate the pan over the burner every so often to help cook the rice evenly. Stay in the kitchen and clean up so you’re right there to adjust the pan when needed. If liquids seem to boil off too quickly, add a little extra warm water/broth.
Add peas and artichokes: After 15 minutes of cooking, scatter the peas and artichoke hearts on top, cook for 5 minutes more. 
Cover to steam: Turn off heat and cover for 10 minutes with a kitchen towel or other cover of choice. This will allow the rice to absorb any remaining liquid as well as steam the peas and warm the artichoke hearts and any other optional ingredients added as noted below. Once done, lightly fluff the rice and serve. Discard bay leaves before eating. Season with salt, pepper or more paprika to taste.
Serve: Garnish with chopped parsley. Pairs perfectly with a side of leafy greens and a big squeeze of lemon over top. Enjoy straight from the pan or serve in individual bowls.
Serves 4 – 6

Burrito,VEGAN BURRITO BOWL,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 



Fajitas

2 tablespoons olive oil or 1/4 cup water for water saute
2 bell peppers (any color), cored and thinly sliced
1 small white onion, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
pinch of mineral salt

To Serve

2 cans (15oz) black beans, drained and rinsed or 3 cups Instant Pot Black Beans
1 batch Cilantro Lime Rice or 3 cups cooked rice
2 heads of romaine, shredded (about 3 – 4 cups)
Corn Salsa
Pico de Gallo
1 – 2 avocados
lime wedges


","

Instructions


The Beans: Start with the beans, I usually make these ahead if making from scratch. If you’re making them fresh, the Instant Po Black Beans will take about 60 minutes to complete. If I don’t want to use homemade, open a can of black beans and simply drain and rinse them.
The Rice: The Cilantro Lime Rice takes about 25 – 30 from start to finish so it’s a good idea to get that started after the beans, unless using canned beans than you can start with the rice.
The Veggies: The fajitas only take about 15 minutes, including prep time, to finish. These can be made while the rice is cooking.

In a large skillet, heat olive oil or water over medium heat. Add the onions, bell peppers, oregano and pinch of salt, and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions and peppers are soft and tender. Remove from heat.

Assemble: To assemble your burrito bowls, in individual bowls add about 3/4 cup of rice, 3/4 cup of beans, 1/4 – 1/3 cup of corn salsa or pico de gallo, and 1/4 of the fajita mixture, along with a handful of shredded lettuce. Add a side of avocado (mashed or sliced), I usually use 1/4 of an avocado per bowl. Top with a squeeze of lime, pinch of salt and a dash of red pepper flakes.
Store: All the leftover components can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 – 4 days. Store individually or together (as for meal prep).

Stuffed Shells,BUTTERNUT SQUASH STUFFED SHELLS,"


Ingredients



Units
USM 

Scale
1x2x3x 




3 – 4 lbs. butternut squash (about 5 – 6 cups), seeds removed and cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic
1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 – 2 cups water or vegetable broth
2 cups cashew ricotta or tofu ricotta
2 handfuls of fresh spinach (about 2 – 3 oz.) or 1 package (10oz.) frozen, thawed and squeezed
20 – 22 jumbo shells
mineral salt, to taste


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.
Prep and roast the squash: Prep the squash, cutting into 1/2 inch cubes. Place squash on baking sheet, drizzle with oil and sprinkle of salt. Place the sheet pan in the oven and roast for 30 minutes. Once done let squash cool a few minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
Make the cashew ricotta: While the squash is roasting, make the vegan ricotta and mix in the spinach. Set aside.
Cook the pasta: Cook the pasta according to package directions, drain and set aside.
Make the butternut squash sauce: In a food processor or high speed blender, add 4 cups of the roasted squash, reserving the rest to stuff the shells. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, thyme, salt and 1 cup of water, blend until smooth, adding more water as needed to thin. I used about 1 1/2 cups, you don’t want it too thin, but not too thick either, use your best judgement. Alternately, Sauce can be made using a stick blender and the pot you cooked the pasta in.
Layer and stuff the shells: Place the sauce at the bottom of your baking dish, spreading it from side to side to coat the entire bottom. Scoop one heaped tablespoon of ricotta filling into each shell along with 3 pieces of butternut squash. Ricotta will fill about 18 shells. Use a 12 inch round or 9×13 rectangular dish.
Bake: Cover and bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 – 20 minutes, or until warmed through.
Serves 6 (3 shells per serving).
Store: Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for 4 – 5 days, in a covered container. For longer storage, keep in the freezer in freezer safe containers (affiliate link) for 2 – 3 months.

Peppers,TOFU SCRAMBLE STUFFED POBLANO PEPPERS,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




4 large poblano peppers
1 block (14 -16 oz.) organic tofu (firm or extra-firm), drained and pressed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)
8 oz mushrooms, sliced (I used baby bella)
1 small bell pepper, diced (any color)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
a large handful of fresh baby spinach (or chopped large leaf)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
mineral salt & pepper, to taste

To serve, optional

sriracha cashew cream or vegan aioli
avocado slices


","

Instructions


Roast poblano peppers using one of two ways.

Oven: Roast in preheated oven at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or so on a cookie sheet, turning halfway in between to flip peppers over.
Broiler: Roast your peppers in the broiler. To do this move the broiler pan about 6 inches away from heating element and preheat broiler. Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet and broil, turning often, until tender and blackened all over, 8 to 10 minutes. 

Steam peppers: Transfer to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to let steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
While peppers are roasting, drain the tofu. No pressing is needed since we’ll cook off most of the moisture, but while prepping the veggies I like to set the tofu on its side in the tub it came in so the excess water will drain.
Tofu scramble: In a large skillet/wok, heat oil over medium heat, add onions, and cook for 4 minutes. Add tofu, crumbling between your fingers, and cook for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, bell pepper and garlic powder, cook for another 3 – 4 minutes. Add spinach, cook for 2 – 3 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Add nutritional yeast and season with salt and pepper. Gently toss and cook for 1 minute.
Peel and de-seed peppers: Remove any loose skin off the peppers. Make one incision down the length of each pepper and carefully remove seeds. 
Stuff peppers: Scoop tofu mixture into peppers. If the peppers need to be heated, using the same baking dish you cooled the peppers in, place under broiler on low for a minute or two, watching closely so nothing burns.
Serve: Top with a drizzle or dollop of cashew cream and avocado slices. Salsa would also be great. I also loved having some warmed corn tortillas on the side as well.
Serves 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 – 15 minutes. Alternatively,  heat in the microwave for 1 – 2 minutes.

Prep the dough: Let dough come to room temperature. Lightly flour a cutting board or flat workstation, gently stretch with your hands and roll out into a 12 inch pizza round. Be patient with the dough, it will want to shrink back (this is because of the gluten) but keep going you’ll get it to stay in place soon enough. Place dough on a good size piece of parchment paper, this is the easiest way to transfer the dough. 
Par-bake dough: Once oven is ready, place dough on baking sheet and bake on the center rack for 7 – 10 minutes.
Layer pizza: Carefully remove pizza dough from the oven and layer starting with the sauce, then the tomato slices, artichokes, olives, chickpeas and finally the red onion. Give a good sprinkle of red pepper flakes and mineral salt.

For the glaze, simply mix maple syrup, tamari, black pepper and rapeseed oil in a small bowl, then brush your skewers with the glaze before placing them onto the hot BBQ. Turn the skewers regularly until the peaches are starting to caramelise and the kebab is lightly browned.
To prepare the tzatziki dip, finely shred the cucumber with a grater or a food processor, then transfer the shreds to a nut milk bag or a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much of the water as you can.
Transfer the cucumber shreds to a large bowl and stir in the salt, then allow it to rest for 10 minutes and squeeze out any releasing liquid again. Mix the cucumber and salt with the dairy-free yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic and fresh dill.
To serve, drizzle the grilled peach & kebab skewers with a little tzatziki and use the rest to dip some freshly toasted pitta bread.

Fajitas,BLACK BEAN FAJITAS + GUACAMOLE,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water (for water saute)
1 small white onion, sliced
1 red bell pepper, cored and sliced
1 yellow bell pepper, cored and sliced
1 green bell pepper, cored and sliced
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon chipotle or cayenne powder, optional
1 can (15 oz.) black beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 teaspoon mineral salt
6 corn or flour tortillas
1/4 head of cabbage, shredded (optional), to serve
lime wedges, to serve

Guacamole

2 – 3 avocados
1 small jalapeno, most seeds removed and diced
1/4 red onion, diced
small handful cherry tomatoes, quartered or 1 small tomato, diced
1/2 teaspoon mineral salt, or to taste
few sprigs cilantro leaves, diced
1 lime, squeezed


","

Instructions


Guacamole: Cut avocados in half lengthwise, remove seed and using a spoon scoop out the flesh, place in medium size bowl. Using a fork cut the halves into large chunks and mash about 1/3 – 1/2. Add diced jalapeno, onion, tomatoes, mineral salt and lime juice. Mix to incorporate. Add in chopped cilantro and mix again gently. TIP: To keep your guacamole from browning, pack your guacamole well, add about 1/4 – 1/2 inch water over top and place in the fridge. When ready to serve, drain water, mix and serve. This will keep air away preventing oxidation.
Fajitas: In a large skillet or wok, heat oil/water over medium high heat, add the onions and bell peppers, cook for about 6 – 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chili powder, cumin and garlic powder, and optional chipotle/cayenne, and cook 1 minute more. Add black beans and cook until heated through, about 3 more minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste adding anything extra you like.
Tortillas: Warm the tortillas. I like to heat mine carefully over the open flame of the stove top.
Assemble: Serve layering the fajita mix on top of each tortilla, then add cabbage and a nice helping of guacamole. Top with a squeeze of lime to each taco if you like.
Serves 3 generously.
Store: Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 4 – 5 days, in a covered container.

Chicken Parmesan,Lemon Almond Parmesan,"
Ingredients

50g whole almonds
2 tbsp nutritional yeast
Zest of 1 organic/unwaxed lemon
¼ tsp good salt

","
Preparation
Yes, you can buy vegan parmesan, but making your own is so much better! Especially when you amp up the tang for an extra-special taste sensation.

Method

Place all the ingredients in a food processor and blitz until you have a powdery consistency – this should take seconds.
Be careful not to over-process, as it will start to turn into almond butter.
Store in a sterilised jar and keep in the fridge.

Teriyaki,TERIYAKI TOFU-TEMPEH CASSEROLE,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




10 oz. organic tofu (extra-firm or super firm), cubed
8 oz. tempeh, cubed
12 oz. combo of snow peas, baby carrots and broccoli florets or 1 bag (12 oz.) stir-fry vegetables (found in the produce section)
1 cup long grain rice or 3 cups cooked rice of choice (quinoa or cauliflower rice would be great too)

Teriyaki Sauce

3/4 cup tamari, low-sodium soy sauce or coconut aminos
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup pure maple syrup (or 1/3 cup cane sugar or coconut sugar)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 teaspoon freshly grated
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder or 1 garlic clove, minced
2 T. cornstarch or 3 T. tapioca flour + equal amount of water


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Prep tofu-tempeh: Drain tofu and place between a clean folded dish towel, place a medium pot on top for about 10 minutes to remove excess water. If using super firm tofu, skip this step. Once done, cube into 3/4 – 1 inch cubes. Cube the tempeh as well.
Make teriyaki sauce: In a small saucepan, add the tamari, water, maple syrup/sugar, ginger and garlic, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook on low for 1 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch/tapioca powder with the water until smooth. Add the mixture to the teriyaki sauce and cook another minute, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. Taste for flavor. If you like your teriyaki sauce on the sweeter side, add an extra tablespoon or two of your preferred sweetener.
Bake tofu-tempeh: In a 9×13 casserole or baking dish, add tofu and tempeh, drizzle with 1 cup of teriyaki sauce and gently toss to coat. Place in oven on middle rack and bake for 20 – 25 minutes. Turn down oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook rice: Cook rice according to package directions. I used basmati rice here which only took 20 minutes total to cook. Rice may vary in cooking time, some take as long as 40 minutes. If making a longer cooking rice you may like to start it earlier.
Steam veggies: Steam the veggies using a bamboo steamer, microwave or whatever is your preferred method.
Combine everything: In dish the tofu-tempeh cooked in, scoot the tofu and tempeh to one side, add the cooked rice and steamed vegetables. Pour most of the remaining teriyaki sauce overtop, reserving a little for serving, toss to combine. Enjoy as is or continue to next step to warm through if needed.
Bake: Place in preheated oven set to 350 degrees, uncovered, for about 10 – 15 minutes to heat through as needed (feel free to skip this step).
Serve: Place in individual bowls and top with a little remaining sauce. Would also be great with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds over top. Enjoy!
Serves 4 generously, or 6 – 8 smaller portions

Teriyaki,GRILLED TOFU SKEWERS + PINEAPPLE-TERIYAKI SAUCE,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 block (14 oz.) organic tofu (firm, extra or super firm)
1/2 of a fresh pineapple
1 red bell pepper
1 large zucchini
1 large red onion,

Pineapple-Teriyaki Sauce

1/2 cup coconut amino’s or low-sodium tamari or soy sauce
1/2 cup pineapple juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 teaspoon fresh grated
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, coconut sugar or pure cane sugar, optional
2 T. tapioca powder or 1 T. cornstarch + equal amount of water


","

Instructions


Press tofu: Drain tofu and place between a clean double folded kitchen towel, or paper napkins. Place a medium stainless steel pot on top to help press the tofu, releasing it of excess moisture. If using super-firm tofu, skip this step. Let set while making the sauce. If using bamboo skewers, at this time you may also like to soak them in water to keep them from burning on the ends.
Make Sauce: In a small saucepan, add coconut amino’s/tamari, pineapple juice, garlic, ginger and optional sweetener, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook on low for 1 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch/tapioca powder with the water until smooth. Add the mixture to the teriyaki sauce and cook another minute, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. If you like your teriyaki sauce on the sweeter side, add an extra tablespoon or two of your preferred sweetener. 
Prep tofu & veggies: Cut tofu into 3/4 – 1 inch cubes, place in a shallow baking dish and add about 1/3 – 1/2 of the sauce, gently toss to coat tofu, cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes. Chop and prep the veggies. Thread tofu & veggies on the skewers, distributing evenly, in whatever order you like.
Grill: Turn on grill to medium high and coat with oil. Once grill is nice and hot, add skewers and cook, turning every so often, until tofu is slightly charred and vegetables are fork tender (or al dente if you prefer), about 8 minutes. Brush with a little sauce on the skewers while cooking if you like. Just be sure to save some for dipping later or adding over top of your grain.
Serve warm with grain of choice. I made a garlic cauliflower rice with chopped cilantro that was pretty darn good! This ginger cauliflower rice would be great too!
NOTES:
If you don’t have pineapple juice on hand, puree 1/2 cup of fresh pineapple and add enough water to equal 1/2 cup, mix well.

Enchiladas,Vegan Enchiladas,"
Ingredients
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp coriander
2 tsp ground cumin
2 cups fresh spinach, chopped
2 cups black beans, chopped in a food processor (canned organic is fine)
4 tbsp shoyu
3 cups cooked, mashed sweet potatoes
Sea salt, to taste
10 large tortillas
Vegan cheese and spring onions for topping
Salsa
","
Method

Preheat oven to 180º C /360 ºF / Gas Mark 4.
Heat the olive oil in a medium pan over a low/medium heat. Add onion and garlic, sauté until onion is translucent. Add coriander and cumin.
Cook for two minutes stirring constantly adding a little water if the pan seems dry.
Add the spinach, black beans, soy sauce and mashed sweet potatoes. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and season with sea salt.
Place ¼ cup of mixture in centre of tortilla. Roll into a burrito and place in a non-stick baking dish.
Once all the burritos are assembled, pour your favourite salsa on top and cover with aluminium foil.
Bake for 25 minutes.
Remove and sprinkle with melty vegan cheese and return to over for 2-5 minutes (until the cheese is melted).
Garnish with sliced spring onions and serve!

Mild Homemade Salsa:
If you do not like things hot (or even warm for that matter!), this is the perfect salsa. You can build your tolerance to greater heat levels if you so desire. Just start with a very little bit of hot pepper.

8 fresh vine ripe tomatoes, chopped
½ cup fresh coriander, chopped
2 onions, chopped
1 bell pepper, yellow, orange or red
½ tsp seal salt
1 lime, juiced

Combine all the chopped ingredients into a bowl stir lightly. Squeeze the lime juice over the homemade salsa.  If you prefer, you can use a stick blender and create a less chunky salsa. This flavourful, mild homemade salsa can be served immediately, but its flavour will be enhanced if you let the tastes develop overnight in the fridge.

Enchiladas,VEGAN ENCHILADAS VERDE,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 



Cashew Cream

1 cup raw cashews, soaked for 2+ hours
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar (optional)
2 tablespoon fresh lime or lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
salt, to taste
1/2 – 3/4 cup water

Vegan Enchilada Sauce

2 lbs fresh tomatillos, husked and quartered
1 medium red onion, coarsely chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 jalapeño, seeded and coarsely chopped
2 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup parsley or cilantro (or combo), chopped
mineral salt, to taste

Enchiladas

1 medium zucchini, chopped into 1/2″ pieces
1 – 2 ears of corn, shucked with the corn cut off the cob
3/4 cup or 1/2 pint cherry/grape tomatoes
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
olive oil
1/2 –1 teaspoon cumin
salt + cracked pepper
1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
9 – 12 corn tortillas


","

Instructions


Cashew cream: Soak the cashews in two cups cold water for 2+ hours or hot water for 5 minutes, drain well. Place cashews, lime juice, paprika, onion powder, salt and 1/2 cup water into blender/nutribullet and blend until smooth. Add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin to desired consistency. Taste for flavor. Add more paprika to your liking, but keep in mind the color will change.
Enchilada sauce: Place the tomatillos, onion, garlic, jalapeno, and vegetable broth in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Carefully, transfer to a food processor/blender, add the cilantro and/or parsley, and salt, process until smooth. Set aside. You may need to process your verde sauce in two batches if using a food processor. (Note: See Salsa Verde for step by step instructions) Makes about 6 cups.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Enchilada filling: Warm the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, add the zucchini, carrots, corn, tomatoes, cumin, and salt, and saute until just tender, about 5 – 8 minutes.
Warm the tortillas: This helps to make them pliable. I prefer to warm mine over the stovetop so the edges get a little charred. Keep them stacked on each other with a towel over top to keep warm. Alternatively, wrap your corn tortillas in a dampened paper towel and microwave 45 seconds.
Assemble: Once everything is ready, start putting the enchilada’s together. Pour 1 cup of the sauce into the bottom of a 9 × 13 baking dish. Fill each tortilla with about 1/4 c of the vegetable mixture, a spoonful of black beans, roll up and place seam side down in the baking dish. Once filled, 2 – 3 cups of the remaining sauce on top of the enchiladas (use more if you like). Pour the cashew creama overtop. Cover with foil and bake 20 minutes. You may also like to leave the foil off for the last 10 minutes to let the exposed tortillas get a bit crispy. Add a finishing touch with fresh chopped cilantro overtop.
Serves 4 – 6

Carpaccio,Fruit Carpaccio w/ Plums + Lemon Ginger Cream (Vegan),"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 



Carpaccio

8 plums (any color)

Lemon Ginger Cream

1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked for 2–3 hours
3 – 4 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1 heaping teaspoon grated ginger (I used a microplane to grate)

Simple Syrup

2 medjool dates, pitted (fresh is best)
1/3 cup water

OR…

1/3 cup pure maple syrup (in place of dates and water)
1/2 vanilla bean, scraped or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla (or both if you like)


","

Instructions


Ginger Cream: Combine ingredients in a small blender (I used the magic bullet) and blend until smooth. You will want it to be on the thick side and shouldn’t need any additional water. But if you forgo the soaking process, you may need to add a bit more. I suggest adding in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or water at a time. If you find your cream is a bit too runny, add in a few cashews and blend. You can serve at room temp or refrigerate a bit before serving. The cream can be made a day or two ahead of time.
Simple Syrup: Combine either the dates, water, and vanilla OR maple syrup and vanilla into a small blender (I used the magic bullet) and blend until smooth. Feel free to add a tad bit more water as needed to thin if using dates. You can serve at room temp or refrigerate a bit before serving. The simple syrup can be made a day or two in advance.
Plums: Slice your plums thinly just before serving. I have given a more detailed way of slicing above. Here is the simple version: I placed my plums on a flat surface with the stem side up and sliced as thinly as I could by hand with a sharp knife starting from the outside and slicing in until I came to the seed in the middle. Do this for both sides.
Assemble: Place the plums however you like on your plate. Serve with a nice drizzle of the simple syrup and a dollop of the lemon ginger cream. Garnish with optional mint leaves. 
Serves 3 – 4

Pork Dumplings,Gyoza Dumplings (Pot Stickers) with Black Vinegar Dipping Sauce,"
Ingredients

For the dipping sauce:
4 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp mirin 
2 tsp toasted sesame oil
3½ tbsp rice vinegar
1 shallot (green onion), finely chopped
½ bunch of fresh chives, finely chopped
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
For the dumplings:
4 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
15g/½oz fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
2 carrots, grated
1 bunch of spring onions (scallions), finely chopped
3 wood ear mushrooms (or any mushroom of your choice), finely sliced
350g/12oz fresh firm tofu
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
400g/12oz pack dumpling skins 

","
Method

To make the sauce, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
For the dumpling filling, heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil in a pan, then add the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli and sauté for about 4 minutes until cooked through. Add the carrot, spring onions and mushrooms, then crumble the tofu into the pan. Cook the mixture for 10–15 minutes until it’s quite dry, then season with the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Leave until cool enough to handle.
Take a dumpling skin in one hand, then dip the index finger of your other hand in a little water and use it to wet the top half of the skin. Put about ½ tbsp of the filling mixture into the middle of the skin, then fold the skin over to form a half-moon shape, crimping and sticking the edges together as you go. Repeat with the remaining skins and filling.
In a large frying pan with a lid, heat the remaining vegetable oil over a high heat. Add the dumplings to the pan and fry, uncovered, for about 4 minutes until the bottoms are golden and crisp.
Add a ladleful of water and quickly put the lid on the frying pan to steam the dumplings for 2 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to fry, uncovered, until any leftover water has evaporated – be careful as the hot liquid can splash. Keep an eye on the bottom of the dumplings at this stage as you don’t want them to burn. Gently lift the dumplings with a spatula and transfer them to a serving plate and serve immediately with the dipping sauce.
